Triple L,1,MYER Melbourne in Bourke St,Bad,Poor customer service by the middle aged lady at the gift wrapping service. She was generally unpleasant and was also rude to kids yelling hurry up when they asked for help. I will not get my gifts wrapped over there again.
Karen Morgan,1,Myer online shopping - very poor experience,Bad,"Recently ordered a blender online from Myer, a week and a half later, still no blender received.  I rang them to inquire what had happened, only to find out it was out of stock.  Myer very happily took my money for this order, but delivered nothing, nor did anyone seek to keep me informed about what had happened, If I had not rang them to find out, I wonder when they may have decided to actually proactively contact me to let me know.  Very poor experience, and has made me very wary about buying online from them again."
Jim Templar,1,30 day returns guarantee means nothing. Scammers!,Bad,"Went to Myers electronics department yesterday to return Bose headphones as I wasn't happy with recent purchase and wanted to exchange under 30 day exchange policy. I was told by customer services that this doesn't apply anymore. He also smugly told me that if I had bought from Bose direct that they would have refunded me according to the 30 day excitement guarantee. So the moral of the story is DON't buy anything from Myers. They don't honour their promises. This lack of integrity explains why this company is doing so badly. Oh by way, a note to the electronics department manager, I have convinced family members to cancel over $10,000 of household purchases with your store. So I hope your Queen Street management reward you for your great customer service (sarcasm.) Also remember the customer comes first, especially if they have been loyal through the years. Neither I nor my family will be visiting Myers again. Lucky we have a David Jones nearby."
Gulam,1,Please avoid shopping at Myer Brisbane…,Poor,"Please avoid shopping at Myer Brisbane City Ladies Fashion department .I bought a Shirt from their clearance rack for my sister. Whilst in the store my sister advised it was the wrong size. I went to change the item the one in her size was soiled.I was told I couldn’t get a refund or exchange it for a full priced item, according to their new policies.The new policy is only printed on the receipt But there is no signage in store and the staff don’t advise you when processing the sale.NO MORE GIFT SHOPPING AT MYER"
Double Colour,1,Dissatisfied with online returns policy,Bad,I'm extremely disappointed with the returns policy. Why would anyone buy from Myer when they charge to return items? Wanted to support an Australian owned business but I've just donated $20 freight charges for no item. Other sites understand it's a risk to buy online and therefore offer a free returns policy. Pity as I'd continue to buy from Myer if they didn't charge to return.
Diane,1,Poor Service,Poor,Just received an email today (18Nov) at 11:53am to say I can collect my online order on 12th Nov. I went and picked it up but I had been there shopping off an on and would  have picked it up last week instead of making a special trip today to collect my order. Very poor service.
Debby Grapsas,1,I was extremely pleased by the…,Excellent,I was extremely pleased by the exceptional customer service I received from Hayley at the Clinique counter at Garden City. Full of knowledge such a lovely young lady. Thankyou so much for all of your help. I will be back to see you again
M.b,1,A lot of room for improvement,Bad,"I bought a pair of expensive shoes when they were having their sale last week ($65 off) and they quickly sold out of a lot of sizes after my order. Coincidently they sent me the wrong size. I called my local store and the woman was extremely blunt and unhelpful. I later called the Myer call centre to help me with this issue. The guy was extremely nice but just said ""return them to your store for a refund"". I now have to go out of my way to return the wrong sized shoes that were sent to me by THEIR mistake, and buy them somewhere else full price? I don't see how that's fair?"
Sue Saber,1,Order on hold,Bad,I put an order on hold and when I got back there they couldn’t find my order.
Dee,1,Disgusted at the customer service given…Still waiting for a reply.,Bad,"Disgusted at the customer service given by Myer.  No one wants to take responsibility.  Purchased a shirt online and the shirt was damaged.  Rang my local store to get a replacement, but they told me that I could just sew the new button back on.  I said that I purchased the item new and that I shouldn’t have to fix it.  They then informed me that no stores in Australia had any in stock and they couldn’t find a replacement.  I rang the complaints line and they informed me that they had lied and that there was a replacement at a store just 100 kms away.  They got the store manager to ring me and he apologised and said that they would get the replacement and he asked if I wanted him to call when it got there. I said yes.  Two weeks later, no shirt, no call so I ring complaints again and they say they will get the manager to call me. 4 days later no call, so ring complaints again.  The phone call took 45 mins, just to be told the store could not find the shirt anywhere and that I could just get a refund.  I asked to speak to management and was told they would get them to call.  I said I would be driving and that they needed to call after 30 minutes.  So I start driving and the phone rings.  Of course I couldn’t answer it.  So I ring complaints the next day and tell them the whole story and that I requested to speak to management.  Told her an exact timeframe they could call.......and 6 days later, I’m still waiting.  This is disgraceful...they have had my money for 5 weeks and I still have a shirt that was damaged, that I paid full price for!"
Carol Berryman,1,What is happening at Myer Tea Tree…,Bad,"What is happening at Myer Tea Tree Plaza? Where are the staff for customer service? I wandered around the cosmetics area trying to find someone or to be seen by staff. Eventually I asked a woman clearly assigned to another area to help me and she went to find a staff member who came but wanted to send me to the Clinique counter ( I wanted to buy a new Revlon product and had questions). This staff member didn't have knowledge of the brand so I had to figure it out for myself. My mother, who was in the shoe department, met up with me and told me her sales assistant seemed disinterested in serving her. Disappointing."
meryl,1,Remembrance Day today,Bad,"Remembrance Day today.  I was absolutely disgusted that while the Last Post was playing and the one minute's silence being observed, Myer Miranda continued to play their in-store music throughout.  Even some of the staff made a comment about how disrespectful it was."
Leonie,2,No refund for sale items.,Poor,What a shame we are unable to take advantage of Myer sales as the new policy means that anything purchased at a reduced price cannot be returned.  Being a country client online shopping is OUT for me now.  Not a good policy.
benson,1,I have shopped in Myer for many years,Great,"I have shopped in Myer for many years, this time I went to Canberra Canter MYER to  buy a bed (on 6/10/2019) not knowing what bed I was looking for, and PAUL ( SealyBedding section) came to my rescue. He was most helpful and went out of his way to find me a bed that I liked .My experience in relation to customer service provided by PAUL was gold star service and he deserves to be acknowledged for it. I did end up buying a bed and I’m happy with that. It is a real treat to have them look after you. Well done PAUL. Well done MYER. Please don’t lose PAUL."
Katie,1,Canberra City Myer - lazy women’s lingerie staff playing on tablet,Bad,"Canberra City Myer Women’s lingerie staff - one older woman - too busy on the tablet to assist. I was there first thing. No other customers around. Asked to be sized her, she said sure, hardly taking her eyes off the tablet. I wait 15 mins in waiting room, nothing. I leave and there she is playing on the tablet still. Absolutely lazy pathetic customer service. I’ve had other instances in the same section ages ago when staff don’t even know there own sales. Deny to give me item at reduced price only to go to Myer Belconnen and have no issues at all."
Edin Saric,1,Kids Wear - Warringah mall,Excellent,"I really enjoyed my shopping experience at Warringah Mall Myer today, great product range and excellent customer service and assistance from Vesna at kid’s wear."
Mim,2,Beware of the new returns policy at…,Bad,Beware of the new returns policy at Myer! Don’t buy Christmas gifts there as you only have a strict 30 Day return policy. Also beware that anyth purchased marked CLEARANCE they will not allow you to return! I used to buy clothes from the clearance section for my husband and children but I’ll never do that again.
Andrea,1,"Where is the customer service, Myer???",Bad,"I spent about an hour in Myer Civic today, not one person asked if i required assistance, I selected items to try on, showed myself into the change room, still no one around! Had to get dressed to go and find another size, all a good fit. I proceeded to the counter to purchase 2 shirts and a dress... you’ll never guess, no one around to serve😳 I waited for a few minutes then left a note on my clothes saying, waited too long! Myer, no wonder you are going broke...poor, poor service!"
Alicia,1,Be warned - Myer staff at call centre 13 69 37 are so rude and so aggressive,Bad,"The rude and aggressive ""customer service"" person on their 13 69 37 number is Phil, and his manager Antoinella is so unprofessional she won't  call you back. Their customer service team on that number has a very defensive, ""us vs them"" attitude. Phil is passive aggressive and talks over the top of you - I couldn't finish one sentence without him, as he put it, ""politely interjecting"". He was raising his voice over the top of mine everytime I tried to speak.I bought a bag online for sale but it was cancelled. I knew it was still available because I could see it online for full price (Myer are con artists). After he refused to send it out to me I asked to speak to his manager. He told me there was nothing she could do. I asked 5 times for his manager & he repeated 5 times that she couldn't help me. After a ridiculous amount of time had passed he finally agreed to have his manager call me, but then proceeded to say again that there was nothing she could do - it was the rudest most frustrating conversation I've ever had. I then purchased the bag online for full price & received confirmation the next day that it had been shipped. I called their team again to speak to the manager Antoinella, Phil answered and said ""Is this about the handbag?"" He left for a minute & then came back and said Antoinella was not available. When I told him the bag was available and was being shipped out to me at full price, he said - I'm glad you got what you wanted. There was no apology and no explanation as to why the item was cancelled at sale price, but shipped out to me the next day at full price. I asked him for an apology and he kept saying - I'm glad you got what you wanted. I kept trying to speak and Phil kept talking over the top of me. I still haven't received a refund or an apology for their dodgy practices and aggressive staff.I emailed Myers complaints team at myercsc... only to be told that I need to call that Phil & Antoinella' s team to resolve this. What a joke - I have to make a complaint to the team that my complaint is about. I seriously can't stand the thought of Myer anymore."
Mary Rooney,1,I ordered a bag on Meyer market site…,Bad,I ordered a bag on Meyer market site the 10th September to be shipped to Perth it only arrived this week. Six weeks later not good enough. Mary Rooney have asked for an explanation. They emailed me for order number last week and have not come back to me
Svoschick,2,Disappointment! Lack of Customer Service,Bad,"If I could give zero stars I would! Ordered from Myer online and one week later the order is still ""in progress"". I called the customer service number and just wasted 30 minutes of my life! They could not explain why the order was stuck and could not give me an estimated time frame of when it would be resolved. I asked for the phone number to the complaints department so i could escalate it, only to be told by the consultant that he didn't know the number and that he can't help me. Why have a customer service team at all if you just answer phones and tell people you can't help them. What is the point really?"
Jacqueline Tong,3,Went to MYER Miranda today,Poor,"Went to MYER Miranda today to purchase a watch, stood there for 20 mins and no one around to serve you at all. I wanted around it try and find someone whilst my partner waited at the counter, when I came back he still hadn’t been served. We ended up leaving and going to david Jones, what a joke!"
Graeme,3,Myer is a sinking ship,Bad,Terrible online experience. After 8 days rang the warehouse and got transferred to Australia post where the phone call ended. Finally got on to warehouse where I was told I had to get partner to email giving permission to talk with me just to tell me where the parcels are as the Myer one card was in their name. Said they would send confirmation email finally but never got it just happens to get goods the next day. The worst online experience I've had in a long time. Not surprised Myer is going down.
SagGilBal,1,Terrible website.,Bad,Tried in vain to order gift card online. Should be easiest thing to do these days. Will not let me enter a  delivery address different to the billing address. Not the first time I’ve had this problem but will be the last as I will not use this site again.
Muthafcka,4,"Bye, Myer!",Bad,"I went to myer chadstone for the final time today. Waited at counter for 15 mins in a queue with 3 others when a second assistant finally arrived she served the first person she saw. That person hadn’t been in the queue but had just barged in. Myer staff have zero customer service skills at all. Good ridence, Myer."
Liz,1,Used to shop at Myer Highpoint…,Bad,"Used to shop at Myer Highpoint frequently. Experience the last 12 months has been awful. When both Estee Lauder and Clinique had free gifts, they didn't have the stock I wanted. Tuesday went over for Lancombe Zen Masque, none available sales assistant said I should try David Jones and told me that they aren't allowed to carry large amounts of stock.With the Clinique product I was advised by online chat that the Jandalop WA store had some that I could pick up.. Also tried to order Sohum diffuser online, only two available so would have to pay for delivery. Any hints here as to Myer sales are dropping."
Jeff Tully,1,3/10/2019 Myer Southland Men's…,Excellent,3/10/2019 Myer Southland Men's department. Assisted by Jillian @ 5.54pm # 72125984I went in to buy a pair of shoes not knowing exactly what I was looking for and Jillian came to my rescue. She was most helpful and went out of her way to find me something that I liked. My experience in relation to customer service provided by Jillian was gold star service and she rightly deserves to be acknowledged for it. I did end up buying a pair of shoes and I'm very happy with it. Thank you again Jillian.
Vindya Madawala,1,I bought an online item yesterday for…,Bad,"I bought an online item yesterday for click and collect. When I was buying it was mentioned that I could collect it after 10am today. After several phone calls, the customer care officer said worst case scenario is that I may have to collect it on Monday. Not happy with the service."
Thomas B,2,Bought my wife a necklace online,Great,Bought my wife a necklace online. She seems happy with it :)
Kacey Hickey,1,While visiting Launceston again this…,Excellent,While visiting Launceston again this year I wandered into the Myer cosmetic department to be looked after by Sue and Tracy on the Lancome section.These two are absolutely delightful and brilliant ambassadors for the store. I had the pleasure of meeting them on my last visit and was really pleased to see them again. If only all cosmetic consultants knew their stuff like these two. Its a real treat to have them look after you.Well done Myer.  Please don't lose them.
Jimmy Chan,1,"My great experience at Myer, George St, Sydney",Excellent,"I went to Myer, George St, last Wednesday 25 Sept 2019 for a men's watch. I went to the ground floor escalators, spoke to a young lady and she took me to the Men's watches..great...At the watches section, I was served by 'Marta' who was so helpful. I bought a GREAT watch....Overall, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE...Thank you!!!"
Gj,1,"Bad service, sale lost",Bad,I went into Myer Adelaide Rundle Mall this morning with the sole intention of buying a large bottle of Chanel Gabrielle. The attendant was deep in conversation with a customer so I politely waited. After trying several times to make eye contact with the attendant I got nothing - not even ‘I’ll be with you in a moment’ .. clearly I didn’t look enough like a serious buyer to her .. so after being ignored I left and bought the perfume from David Jones.
Suzanne Dawn Milne,1,Went to Myer in North Lakes.QLD to…,Excellent,Went to Myer in North Lakes.QLD to purchase sunglasses bought a pair but after 3 days took them back due to unsuitability  The young man helped me try on so many more  but due to me not finding a suitable pair happily refunded my money in full he was a very helpfull nice person
Mark Duffus,1,I received a birthday e voucher via…,Bad,"I received a birthday e voucher via email and thought I would purchase something online. It all seemed OK, there was a mention of limited stock. But it did not say not available. So I purchased the item (DJI Tello drone Kit $239). Because of the price it came with free delivery. The purchase was made on 18th Sept 2019, so the next couple of day I logged into the online tracking of the order and was told tracking was not available. So I presumed it had not shipped. Checked the expected delivery times - 4-7 days. 26th Sept 2019 I logged on to track the order and was still unable to track. So called the contact number and this is where the I was astounded at how bad there online store was and why MYER may not be around for very long. I was told that the order had been attempted to fill several times and failed so they would give me a refund. But I was told there system said there was one of the items at the Brisbane store but their system cannot fulfil from a physical store so I would have to get the refund then try and contact the store to see the item really was available. So Myer cannot pull stock from their stores only from a warehouse!  And the kicker is that If I hadn't phone up there was no trigger within there system to contact me to notify me of the delay or inability to supply.... My order would be left in a loop. In an age of online shopping MYER fails! Oh also now I have to wait 3 business day for the money to come back after I respond to and email and fill out the necessary info..."
Janice Krieger,1,The online Click and collect is RUBBISH,Bad,"The online Click and collect is farcical. I placed my order at 11.37am and the order was supposed to be ready in 3 hours. Rubbish, I had to chase them up, physically go to the store without the “collect email” as it was over 3 hours.And when I requested to be put through to the store when I tried to chase up the progress of the order, was passed to the incorrect one.Also, where is the customer service email???? No wonder they are not doing well."
Alison Searle Butcher,1,I was served on Thursday,Excellent,"I was served on Thursday, 19 September by a lovely lady called Lily in the shoe department.  She was so professional, so helpful and went beyond what I've had before in terms of service.  I was so happy with my 2 pairs of shoes as I struggle to get anything decent with my big feet (size 43 European!).  Thank you Lily, I really appreciated it."
Belinda,4,Generally good products and options,Great,Generally good products and options. Shipping was good and tracked via Australia Post
Angela,1,Myer's online customer service is really bad!!!,Bad,Myer's online customer service is exceptionally bad - they are no help whatsoever - the money wasn't uploaded onto a gift card I purchased at a store and when I asked them for further information the assistant said 'sorry I can't help you have a good day' and hung up - BEWARE OF PURCHASING GIFT CARDS - I just wasted $50 and they won't help and don't care!!!
Jennie Stoop,1,Happy with helpful Kathy,Excellent,"Today I was looking for classical shirts for my husband. It was not easy to find the right size. Kathy, the team member,  was very helpful and we succeeded to find three fine shirts. I am happy with that! Thanks."
Adrian Goold,1,I shopped in Myer Morley today and a…,Excellent,I shopped in Myer Morley today and a staff member called Dee Catalano was in Morley store from the city. She went out of her way to source a dress for me which we found 1 only in the city store. I was very happy as I did want this particular dress.  She made my shopping very satisfying. Please acknowledge her great service. It was a pleasure to shop at Myer. thanks Liz Goold
Phyllis Heath,1,Excellent service. Excellent product.,Excellent,"I want to praise the service received from Jarrod and Ben in the electrical department of Myer in Cairns over the past 2 days.I wanted advice on buying a Bluetooth speaker which would cope well with the spoken word and not have too much bass. On my first visit to the shop Jarrod talked me through the speaker selection and let me see and hear the recommended Ultimate Ear Boom 3. He gave me his card and assured me that he would willing to answer any more question I might have. The next day I phoned to speak to Jarrod to ask if I could bring in my android phone, connect to the Boom 3 and listen to some speech and music.Jarrod was busy serving another customer and I was a little reluctant to explain my mission to the other assistant who asked if he could help me. My reluctance was undeserved. Ben proved to be another polite, knowledgeable young man. He helped me connect and listen to the speaker and I happily purchased one.Being a lady in my 60’s, I am frequently either ignored or treated in a condescending manner by young members of staff in electrical shops or departments. Neither Jarrod nor Ben displayed any hint of this approach. I can not praise them highly enough.Thank you Myer for employing staff in that department who both know their subject and know how to help people to buy the right product."
Eden Edison,1,The worse experience ever with Myer…,Bad,"The worse experience ever with Myer online, I ordered and expected to receive in the time frame however they never delivery good customer service, all they could ever say is unfortunately! I mean everyone is busy when they expecting an items they already set up their time frame, especially to click and collect at the store. When i came in they told me unfortunately it's not ready to be collect, asked them how long it will take, they answered they don't know?!! Ridiculous experience with them many times, i think i will better shop with DavidJones instead."
Melissa Herron,1,Bra shopping made easy at Pitt St Mall Myer,Excellent,"I went to Myer in Pitt Street Mall, Sydney to go bra shopping. Having not been bra shopping for many years, the sales drew me in. I went at 11am on a weekday to avoid crowds and was really impressed by the customer service. Someone helped me find a few bras to try on, and another lady helped me in the dressing room to get the right fit. I was very impressed and left the store with a bargain and a smile on my face. Thanks!"
Meropi,1,The perfect fit!,Excellent,We went into MYER Chadstone (men’s department) and served by Jimmy and another female young staff member who helped us choose a pair of black jeans for my son suitable for his size and shape. They both provided us with exceptional service considering my son was not with us. They served us with patience and excellence asking questions to ensure we had the right fit for him and were happy with our decision. Can’t thank them enough for helping us out. The jeans fit perfectly !
Louis Murphy,1,Myer Online is a hoax.,Bad,"Bought a Sonos Sub on line using Afterpay. Order was accepted and payment completed. I received a confirmation from Myer telling me order was accepted. I then received email saying order was cancelled because item was unavailable nationally, locking up my money for a week waiting for refund.. I then went into Myer site and saw numerous stores had the item. I called Myer online and they said their stock system is not up to date and I should call a store and see if they will release it to online system.” Basically “ so sad too bad. I called Myer Gsrden Scott and the helpful person that I was speaking to advised they had one in stock but I can’t use Afterpay In store. I asked if I could lay by the item but was advised yeas Myer does layby but not on electrical. My lesson from this is that Afterpay customers are inferior and that shopping with Myer is not a satisfying retail experience. I have purchased the item elsewhere. I hope I get my money back soon. Cash is best and shopping with retailers that want your business is better"
Jake Johnson,1,"(myer online) Don't waste your time, or money.",Bad,"Have used their online service twice this week (trying to order the same item three items) and have had no luck. It says 'available' online, I pay for express deliver on the 3 only to be sent x1 parcel with express and informed the other 2 are currently unavailable and will be sent 'standard shipping free of charge' (standard was free anyway as I spent more than required). After kicking up a fuss about how I could pay for express only to be downgraded to standard 'free of charge' they ignored me for several hours before cancelling x2 of my products (no mention of a refund) and sent through a 'sorry turns out we don't have these items anywhere we've cancelled the orders'. Absolutely disgusting, no refund has been made yet and currently have no response from Myer. So in the last 3 days I've payed in excess of $300 to Myer Online and have 1 $39 t shirt (which I actually paid near $50 for including shipping). So I've got an over priced t shirt, a bad experience and no refund in sight. Don't waste your time or money."
Sharmila Lal,1,Myers Blacktown has poor customer service,Bad,"Today I went to my local store in Blacktown with my mum who is disable both physical and mentally. I have always in the past 15 years given good reviews for this store. But I was disgusted by the girl who served my mum. My mum wanted To buy channel no5 but because she’s a pensioner she could only afford the 35ml. I asked the girl her name was saj  if they had 35ml and she said no they have sold out. She said they have only 100mls and above left and said we could purchase that . I said to my mum don’t worry I can go to Burwood and get it from David Jones. The girl immediately interrupted and said let me check the draws below and when she opened the draws there was  at least 4 x 35ml channel no 5. The Girl Saj’s intention was to make her sales for the day and she wanted my mum to pay $240 for the bigger size so that she makes her sales for the day. These Myer staffs have no empathy, they cannot relate to their customers and they lie so much just to get that extra bucks even from a disabled pensioner. It’s cruel and ruthless of them to act so disconnected."
Stella Nobbs,1,I had one of the best customer service…,Excellent,"I had one of the best customer service experience when I visited your store at Miranda on Sunday 1 September. I was looking for a personal garment and could not find what I was looking for, too many choices I guess. I was approached by Joanna Stewart who asked me if she could help.  I explained what I was looking for and in a minutes she provided me with a number of items and asked if I would like her to assist me. I said I would call her if I needed her, she said she would be outside the fitting room. Nothing fitted me, I called Joanna and she went out to provide me with a couple more sizes. I did not like any. I asked Joanna whether the item I was wearing was still in stock, she confirmed and provided me with two colours to chose from. by now I had tried 8 items. She assisted me at checkout with a smile. I kept on apologised for putting her through the ordeal, she just smiled and said it was not a problem. Being in a CS work area myself I was very impressed by Joanna's professionalism and attention at all times.Joanna deserves a pat on the back."
Crossan,1,Gift card in hand and no one to help 😕,Bad,"As I have a Myer gift card I thought I would use this to purchase my wedding lingerie at Myer Carindale. The range to choose from is exstensive and not having much experience in wearing figure hugging lingerie I needed some help. I approached two ladies who were chatting to ask for some help with sizing, only to be told that was the only sizes they had left and that’s why it was on the sales rack and then she walked away. Never  asking me what I was looking for or if I needed help. I entered the fitting room to try my selection on. I notified a Sales Assistant that I was there and if I could try a few things on.  As I struggled quietly not once did an assistant come to check on my sizes or if I needed help. Not knowing if I had chosen correctly and feeling disheartened with no help I discarded my choice and left the store. Lift your game Myer!! If this is how customers are treated no wonder you are a dying breed."
Marsha Wehbe,1,If you are ever at the Myer Roselands…,Excellent,"If you are ever at the Myer Roselands Store , you must ask for Layla in the perfume department . So Friendly and such wonderful customer Service skills , really happy that my family and were served by LAYLA at the Myer Roselands Store."
Joseph,1,Maria at Myer Warringah mall in the…,Excellent,Maria at Myer Warringah mall in the cosmetics department. Was fantastic. She went above and beyond and I have never received customer service to that extent!!
Penelope Newton,1,Northland,Excellent,"Northland - ladies shoes. Stephanie was great. Friendly and Soooo helpful. I don't enjoy shopping but Stephanie was happy to get me different sizes and styles to try and left me be while I weighed up my options. I did take a while as I had previously bought boots elsewhere and they have never been comfortable but I hate shopping. Myer had a good selection, wide foot options, sale and saved $80 and used a gift card. Thanks Stephanie!"
ornagh griffin,1,I recently purchased some kitchen ware…,Excellent,"I recently purchased some kitchen ware at myer bondi junction with the assistsnce of marie teresa. She provided thoughtful, insightful and practical help for us. It was a very pleasant and succesful purchase🙌"
christina peros,3,Exceptional Customer Service,Excellent,"I visited Myer Northland  menswear today (17/8/2019) to purchase a suit for my husband.We were served by a staff member by the name of Joannewho has to be the most preferential staff member we have encountered. Her knowledge of suits was  incredible.She organized the perfect suit,the perfect shirt and the perfect tie.Nothing was too much trouble and took the time to make sure that everything was perfect and we were happy with every product we purchased.Even her happy manner made it even more pleasurable. I would certainly shop there  again and recommend the great service.Well done Joanne."
Georgi Baldock,1,I got a Myer and coles group gift card…,Bad,I got a Myer and coles group gift card for my birthday and i was trying to buy something online on the Myer online website and I found that you can only use it in store which I found it ridiculousNever shopping with Myer
Ying,1,I have purchased two Myer gift cards at…,Bad,"I have purchased two Myer gift cards at Woolworths a few weeks ago and tried to spent it at the Myer Melbourne store today. When the salesperson tries to swipe it, he said it wasn’t activated. looked at me blankly like I was just supposed to throw the card away. So I asked him what can I do with the card. He just said to go back to Woolworths. Not very helpful. So I thought I will check with another salesperson. this other lady told me well she can’t fix it, go to customer service. If I have the same instructions from the first guy then I wouldn’t have to ask her, she looks like I was wasting her time or something But otherwise, the nice customer service lady was able to refund what I have paid on credit and deduct it off the gift card. I was glad to get rid of the gift card and won’t have to go back to Myer store  again"
Carla van Raay,1,When I am in need of a new bra,Excellent,"When I am in need of a new bra, as I was today, I make a point of going to Myers because of their fitters there. In particular, I seek out Teresa, a long-term staff member at Garden City with great experience. She picked out the right bra for me straight off - no need to try on several others. I bought two."
Lyka,1,excellent service,Excellent,"Just had an excellent experience  with a staff from myer indooroopilly  this afternoon.Looking for a specific tokito coat and the lady who helped me really go extra miles. She look for the item even rung other store and called me a few times. Although the coat was not found, I am surprised with the service. I called sydney cbd and found the coat. The staff was also good in sydney and the transaction was easy ( ordered via phone) now, i am just waiting for the item to arrive in victoria. Just hope the item is in good condition. Thanks myer staff in both city."
Sophie,1,Worst customer service and complaints…,Bad,Worst customer service and complaints handling I've ever experienced. Refuse to apologise or take responsibility for THEIR errors at the cost of the customer.
rebecca smith,1,Terrible Customer Service,Bad,"I went to Myer to buy an expensive eyeshadow. I had only 15 mins spare before going to work but I knew what I wanted and where it was. I got to the counter (M.A.C) but the two girls were faffing around two other women and ignoring the other potential customers. A simple - 'I'll be with you in a minute', or 'can I help?' would not have gone astray. The girls kept faffing and faffing about and ignoring at least 3 other potential customers. My time was running out so I asked a lady in another section. She saw how indifferent the two M.A.C girls were and commented loudly ""well they obviously don't want to make a sale"" and tried to help. Turns out they'd run out of what I wanted, but they could have broken their tepid discussions and told me when I first asked. They were fully unhelpful. I had no time left to look for an alternative and left without making a sale. Today I went online and brought the product directly from M.A.C. A direct result of poor customer service. Had these two treated me as a respected customer (as I do in *my* customer service job) I could have found an alternative in the shop."
Darian Au,1,Worst customer service ever!,Bad,"Visited the Northland Store in Melbourne today and got the worst treatment ever by one of its staff in the shoes department. I asked for a pair of shoes in my size. She agreed to look for it, after 5 minutes she came back with the shoe and completely ignored me. She pretended she didn't see me and helped out another customer to find a shoe size. It's not until I got annoyed and asked her if she has them in my size, she has the decency to tell me, they were not available in my size and her excuse was sorry I didn't see you. I am of Asian background, I think she treated me as a second class citizen which I think it's totally unacceptable in this day and age. I have never felt so humiliated and annoyed. I won't name any names, but that blond, old woman, with lots of makeup on should be retrained to have better manners or Myer will continue to lose lots of sales."
Helen,2,I have had a few bad experiences in the Myer store.,Bad,"I have had a few bad experiences in this store. Some people who work there think they can treat you like their worst enemy and get away with it. I took my mother into the cosmetics section on e day. The cosmetic consultant took one look at her and said""I don't think your mother has ever washed her face!"" this comment was insulting and very hurtfull. how can they allow someone like this work for a major store like this. I think this sales woman has never had to wash her tongue out by her mother. Good gracious!"
C/O David,5,Myer no longer customer service oriented,Bad,My partner was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Prior to beginning chemotherapy he was given an extension on his unused gift arc until the end of July 2019. Upon attempting to use this month he was advised the card has been expired. Upon contacting customer service he was advised that it was never extended. They refused to assist. I don’t understand there reasoning behind the refusal as the card contains a monetary value of an initial cash purchase. Myer is no longer a brand that stands for quality customer service!

Tracydavid Kuvekalovic,1,elitest attitude.,Bad,"went to MYER Carousel on the 18th July Thursday around 6.10 pm.  just walking through MYER to take a short cut through the shop . Got to the perfume section of the store and one of the famale staff was standing around with thoes perfume samples that there supposed to hand out to customers. No hello would you like a sample , she looked me up and down and turned the other way as i was going past . I gave her friendly smile and wave like i always do to any of the staff no matter what shop i am in and just to get that treatment. MYER is notorious for judging people by what customers look like and pretentious attitude .And by far MYER carousel is the worst place to shop . The so called staff really need to take a good hard look at themselves as they are no better than anyone else and are going to lose customers with that sort behaviour."

Liz,1,Myer customer service is the worst you…,Bad,"Myer customer service is the worst you can possibly come across. The staff can be rude, short tempered and you would feel they are screaming at you.I have been following up with them for an online shopping issue, where  the item seems to have been lost or delivered to incorrect address, but no sympathy from the staff, they sound more frustrated than the customer who paid $$$ and lost her item. I regret making the purchase from Myer."
Sarah Corry,1,This has been the worst online shopping…,Bad,"This has been the worst online shopping experience I have ever encountered. At the time of ordering a baby cutlery gift set, the estimated delivery time was 4-7 business days. 8 weeks later the items had not arrived. During this time I made over ten calls to Myer, each time the customer service person offered no form of solution or could not tell me where my items were. They blamed the external supplier or the courier company. I have still not received my items.NEVER again will I order through Myer online. TERRIBLE."

Leigh P,2,"I thought I bought ""new""...",Bad,"I just bought the kenwood triblade hand mix machine with other accessories yesterday 10/7/2019.I bought this ""new"" from Bendigo Myer.Opening the box at home I noticed some of the plastic wasn't on the items, on closer inspection I noticed the plastic that protects the blade was missing on a few items as well.After washing the plastics I saw a red piece of something on the side of a plastic item. I took a photo. And other photos.Looking into this closer no plastic cover on the plug, and then reading the warranty booklet I see this item, a food item ! Has been ordered online in June 2019, delivered June 11, potentially used,returned to the shop and now sold as ""new "" in shop. I contacted Delonghi (who own Kambrook) He told me b/c it's a food item should never had been put back on shelf for re-sale.I also contacted consumer Affairs for into. Then I contacted the store, I spoke to a Mgr who listened, told me it's a human error. We discussed sending my item back, and sending me another one.I asked for a good will gesture, no nothing. A $20 vouchers will be sent to me in the return bag being sent, but, I'm to send this one at my cost.. ?!Not sure if I can trust Myer again, considering I could of bought from anywhere online."
Sims Ahluwalia,1,Worst department store in the world,Bad,"I am being generous by giving them 1 star. If I could leave a zero for this experience then I would have done that. I bought a pair of track pants from myer online. Selected click and collect from Chadstone store. Went and picked it up yesterday. While I was there I decided to try them on to make sure I had the right size. Unlucky that I did as I discovered I had the wrong size and I needed a medium size. Went to the counter and said to the lady who cant be named however just say she was a young, blond women working near the brand Kenzi. If you see her run the opposite way as her service will just give you a headache and grief later on. I said to her I want to exchange the size of these track pants. She said because you bought it online we can exchange the size of the track pants. What we need to do is return these one on the iPad and then I can sell you the right size on the cash registers. She said your online order will be refunded back to you the way you paid. And then you pay for the right size by cash or card today. I told her forget it and just refund this track pants as I have already wasted enough time and just want this nightmare to finish. Anyhow she works at Myer so you would hope she knows what she is doing. So I gave her my order number and she organised the return for me. She asked me if I wanted her to hold onto the right size of the track pants and I said forget it I have no intention of every buying anything from Myer. I asked her if she needed anything from me regarding this return and she said no everything is done. I asked for a receipt and she said it’s all been done. So I took her word and left the store empty handed. I did not receive any emails regarding the refund. So finally I bit the bullet today and contacted Myers online services and Lo and behold there is no refund, all they can see is that the item was collected yesterday. So the staff put me through to Myer Chadstone hub and once again they had no records of the item being refunded. So now I am out of money and no track pants either. Honestly the staff I dealt with didn’t even trust me about what happened. This is after explaining to them exactly what time I visited what counter I went. I even gave them a description of staff member and what I was wearing. Anyways she said I will have to escalate this to a manager so they can look at the cameras because of course they can’t trust a customer as we are all a bunch of liars and their staff is the only honest people. Now at this time I wondered if I contacted the police and said Myer stole from me what would they do about the complain. They would probably assume I am either drunk or doing drugs. However if it was a customer walking out unknowingly or knowingly without paying by now they would have had a visit from the cops for stealing. So why the double standards. As far as I am concerned Myer stole from me legitimately as that staff didn’t put through my refund. Anyways moving on I got a phone call from someone called Jimmy and he apologised and explained to me the staff could have done an exchange of size for me last night and if they didn’t know how to do it they should have called a supervisor or manager to get it done. Honestly I don’t care mate all I care is about my refund. I can go to David Jones and buy a pair of track pants from them and at least they won’t try and steal from me. If you cant spend money on training your staff it’s not the customers issue. We pay a premium price for things at Myers and it’s because of the service. At least you have lost one customer for life as I have no intention of ever buying anything from Myers ever again. And you guys have taught me an important lesson that never to trust any staff at any retail stores and to always get a receipt. By people shopping at Myers we are encouraging this bad behaviour and daylight robbery by you mob.All I can say so good riddance for me."
Kath Buchanan,1,Bree Myer Chermside fantastic service,Excellent,Recently attended Myer Chermside and Bree attended to my daughter in the fitting of new bras.  Great experience Bree worked so well with my daughter to find the right fit.  Very happy and would highly recommend her.
Oliver,1,Pathetic customer service online!,Bad,"Pathetic customer service online when purchasing, stay away and shop at David Jones!Its been 32 days since first contacting Myer regarding a faulty pair of shoes. Not to mention two trips to the post office and two phone calls...Myer has ZERO customer service and legit don’t even care.DO NOT BUY FROM MYER ONLINE!"
Aliete Almeida,1,I don't even know if Mayer has a…,Bad,I don't even know if Mayer has a customer service as I have sent several emails regard a charge of an item that supposed to have been canceled because one of the staff suggested to make the order online while I was in store. She made the order on my behalf ( what a regrettable decision)  and it was the wrong size  when she realized it  she had to reverse the order to the right size it took me one hour waiting for her to sorted. She told me the money was refund back to my card and gave me the receipt. I went to another store and bought the item in another color in the correct size but  4 days later I received the online order( wrong size). Since then I am trying  to contact customer service to sorted it out but no response from them.  I gave up but never will buy in Mayer again. I am done dealing with a business that has no morals to it customers.
Belinda Arlove,1,I would like to thank Irene,Excellent,"I would like to thank Irene, at the hub today at Eastland Store, I had to return an item, we are moving at moment and misplaced the receipt, the item was purchased thru afterpay last week, no problem, she went above and beyond  and made this soo easy for me, (I hate returning items, especially without reciept), again thank you IRENE!!!"
DJ,1,Amazing shopping experiences,Excellent,I always shop at MYER Chatswood as it is my local store. We get warm welcome and amazing customer service especially in cosmetics department. Staff is so helpful and actively working for their customers. I will highly recommend Myer Chatswood store for shopping with family than other Myer stores. Amazing customer service!!
Debra Kurth,1,Shocking customer service department,Bad,Shocking customer service department - They certainly need a shake up about what customer service actually is.  They also might need a new Customer Service Manager/Supervisor.  I have just waited 17 mins to get through to their Department and I have given up contacting them by phone.  I will now put in an official complaint as I was overcharged 6 times for a jacket by their so called online buying system and it has now been over a week and they have still not refunded to my account the correct amount.
fiona li,1,Terrible service,Bad,"I visited the Myer in Macquarie shopping centre yesterday and experienced terrible service. I bought perfumes for my husband’s birthday. The perfume counter girl told me they were not providing wrapping service however upstairs Myer Hub counter can help me. So I went there and queued quite long time till my turn. The staff on that counter put down my name and contact number and told me come back to collect it 45min later. Around 1.5 hours later, when I returned and came to find my perfumes were still lying on the counter table and not wrapped at all!! And nobody at the counter! Finally a person came and told me he would make the wrapping done within 5 min. However it turned out to be another 15min! The extremely disappointing thing is their wrapping is rubbish- which is the worst and ugliest wrapping I have ever seen! Not as good as my 8-year-old daughter’s work!! I am really disappointed with Myer Macquarie will not recommend anyone to go there!"
Catherine Bennett,1,Good luck if waiting on refund after they cancel your order,Bad,"I ordered a number of small items at myer market online ... received 3 packages within a week but 2 items were missing. contacted customer service and they said were in back order ... a week later i noticed they were removed from the order summary online and the total of the order had been reduced by the $18 for these items. When i again contacted customer service i was told i had been refunded... which i hadn’t. the full original charge had gone through on PayPal and there was no refund! So it has gone on for 4 weeks and multiple phone calls now ... they finally looked into it, they found Finance had the refund on hold, got it moving... i finally received email notice that this part of order was cancelled and a refund would be issued .. then nothing.. more phone calls.. they tell me i have to follow up with paypal but have given me no date or transaction number and absolutely no proof they have refunded anything. The onus is on me to make sure the payment for purchases goes to them, why is the onus of chasing refunds also on the customer! If i get one more email telling me to check my paypal carefully as if i am dumb enough to have missed a refund .. i shall scream."
Sally Barnes,1,Excellence.  What more could a girl want!,Excellent,"Mia at Sass and Bide at Myer Melbourne deserves an award for her amazing customer service.  She managed to source the last remaining Sass and Bide jacket in Australia that was my size, by getting it transferred from interstate.  She posted it on Friday, and I received it this morning (Monday). She also went went out of her way to inform me that it was on  sale, which prompted me to purchase it.  I can’t thank her enough for her service, and will definitely be buying more Sass and Bide through her. The whole process was so easy and convenient.  What more could a girl want!!!"
Paul,3,Ordered some gloves from Myer Online…,Bad,"Ordered some gloves from Myer Online with next day delivery.The gloves where coming to work. I received an email saying they had been delivered at 6:59pm. No one was at work to collect them. Had Rtb as the signature.Came in the next day to check if they had been delivered. No where around.Ended up calling StarTrack. They said it was a night delivery and couldn't be changed to a daytime delivery. Said Rtb was from the driver (Return to base), so it headed back over to Port Melbourne although the email from them said it had been delivered. StarTrack said I would have to contact Myers and ask them to send them an email to redeliver the package.Called Myers. Had to get it delivered to home address because they can't change to daytime delivery. Said they would get it delivered to my house between 7pm and 9pm. Got home and waited. Nothing.I'm guessing this saga is going to be revisited again today because this is obviously my fault."
Michael McCrory,2,Very bad service,Bad,"Very bad service. i ordered a specific item online and had to chase up the delivery a couple of times before being told the stock was on back order. The lady on the phone was awesome, but the store and process was very ordinary. Also had no way to complaint to them personally. I will never use again."
Swasti,1,Disgraceful service,Bad,"Disgraceful service. Not only I have had to follow up on my click and collect order multiple times, when the transaction was finally processed, my credit card was charged twice for the same order. When I contacted customer service I was advised they were still waiting for Finance to provide an update. This has been going on for 3 weeks and my duplicate charges have not been resolved. No updates are provided and I am simply sick of following up. Pick up your game Myer, disappointed with your service."

Cat Cimino,1,Dissappointed!,Bad,"MYER was my go to store for fashion and gift shopping, now I am deciding whether to ever order again from them. This last online purchase, found my order being processed sent to my old address of 4 years ago, and wasting time on the phone to Australia post and MYER customer service. Aus post were helpful, and I called MYER 2 times to fix this. The first call I can no believe, to change the address and fix where it was being sent and see why that address was still even being used, when I have ordered since moving, the lady told me to call back 4 hours later that day to fix, which I did, and it was not the case. The second person said they could not remove the address and I had to log in and do so. When I did this, the old address was not even present there, wow! At this point frustration and anger kicked in. The third lady at Myer was excellent, though I still don’t know if the package will arrive to correct address, fingers crossed! A fail by MYER..... Latest update - both parcels still sent to wrong address after all the time on the phone with MYER, and since I have tried to order online, and when I log in with my address since posting this review, I can not make any order and page just says can not work for some reason, coincidence? I think not. I tried on different devices and same thing, so I tried logging in as a guest and no problem putting order through, funny that!!  I have reduced my review to 1 star"
customer DB,2,"This should be a rating in minus,",Bad,"This should be a rating in minus - the product was advertised in print media but was not available in store and I was directed to order on line. The on line experience was poor, requiring multiple attempts.Then I could not track the order on line, after a week I rang the 1300 number to find there was never any stock, not available when ordered. If I hadn’t rang I would have not been notified for another 2 weeks - told that is just the way the system works! I needed to then cancel the order for a refund to be processed, the call centre operator continued to say it was the way the Myer system worked - well in my experience it doesn’t work at all. Very poor experience Myer - look out shareholders you are in for a big dive if this organisation doesn’t improve its on line capability and provide, at a minimum - reasonable customer service. Be very careful about ordering on line with Myer - look for alternatives."

S F,1,Today I tried to make a purchase online…,Bad,"Today I tried to make a purchase online for a total of $787.  The Myer website declined the credit card transaction and said to check my details were correct.  After re-entering the card number a couple of times I called my bank to check what the issue was.  My bank told me there was no issue and Myer had already charged me $787 5 different times for a total bill of almost $4k!!I called Myer to ask them to cancel 4 of the orders, but Myer customer service told me that they didn't have any orders in their system for me.  They have requested a refund for me, but they will take a week to process it. So now I sit and wait, in the meantime I have to try to pay the rest of my bills with 4k less money than I thought I had."
Mitchell Kerr,7,Myer - Probably the world's worst customer service.,Bad,Purchased through myer 10 days ago. The transaction kept saying error so I tried a different card. After about 20 minutes I gave up as the transaction would not go through. Shortly after this I realised one of my cards had been charged 4 times and one had been charged twice. A gift card I had used also now showed zero balance even though no order was processed.I've now been dealing with customer service for the past 10 days to try and rectify the situation. My cards have been reimbursed today which is good however 10 days later they still have not reimbursed my gift card. I advised from day one that the item I was buying was for a birthday which now must arrive in 3 business days time and yet still I haven't received anything. Guess the express shipping is now another cost I have to take on.... Thanks Myer!As always Myer never ceases to surprise when it comes to customer service. It's on par with the worse in the world. No wonder you've nearly gone broke several times!

Melissa Hatton,1,Very disappointed,Bad,"Hi Myer,I just wanted to give my opinion on your customer service at Macquarie Centre Myer, My Mum and I are deeply upset with the way we were treated today we spend so much money at your store and we should not be treated the way we were, No one wanted to help us at the iron section I had to get a tefal person to help us and then when we went to purchase the item the older lady and man were serving one customer and left us standing there until then the older lady walked away with out acknowledging us and the man said won't be long 5 minutes later he is still serving her So my Mum and I walked away to another register. I cannot believe you don't have the appropriate staff and the staff that you do have have no customer service what so ever. We will consider next time not coming into your Mayer shop and spending our money else whereI hope we get a personal apologyThank u Melissa"

My wife and I went to the store and Adrienne had saved 2 jackets for me to choose from and then personally fitted both the jackets on me, just good old fashioned service. Wonderful."

Toni Louise Binns,1,Fantastic service,Excellent,"I was so impressed with the quality of service given by Susanna up on the men's wear department.Her friendly, helpful attitude and nothing was a problem, I was buying gifts for my family in WA and she suggested the free shipping straight to my family. Myer launceston is very fortunate to have a sales consultant like Susanna."
Ashley,1,Absolutely disgusted in the service…,Bad,Absolutely disgusted in the service that's provided in the penrith office by the ladies on the perfume floor not only was it a poor experience twice with my mother on law I encountered one myself I wouldn't waste my time money or energy on these ladies that are nothing but rude and judgemental with there absurd gestures of paying customers been theieves and snarly comments
F Ian Curtis,1,Five star service from lydia at Myer Carindale,Excellent,"Five star service from Lydia at Carindale Myer. I have just returned with purchases from the dining ware and cutlery department of Myer Carindale Queensland.Staff person Lydia provided the best shopping experience I've ever had in Myer, with support, educating me about the items and accessing stock. All done with enthusiasm and grace.Five stars Lydia , thank you so much. Ian Curtis"

Alan Doherty,1,Many thanks to Kim from Erina Fair…y,Excellent,"Many thanks to Kim from Erina Fair Women's section who spent a great deal of time and moved mountains of red tape to help me.  My son had given me a beautiful overcoat for Mothers Day which was too small. Not wanting to hurt him I approached Kim who found there was a larger size available.  Kim, ably aided by Sharon when the computer caused problems, managed to set up the order for the replacement. I was amazed when notificationl came that a replacement had  been found in a suburb of Townsville and is already on its way to my front door by Australia Post.  I am so happy.ANITA DOHERTY"
Tracey Bono,1,Thanks Jo Anne from Myer Shellharbour,Excellent,"Thanks Jo Anne from Myer Shellharbour For going 5 star service, very rarely happens any more, so it should not go without a shout out, Jo Anne works in ladies clothing and was able to track down a much needed item. Thanks again"

Anna Para,1,Myers Robina,Bad,"Have been to this store numerous times as I work in the area dressed in business attire as always!One particular day was my day off from work and I was off to purchase a gift,  I walked in with my pram, baby asleep and casual attire with my bun up and No makeup “wow watch out your a true target or theft ” I was watched the entire time!!!By disgruntled looking woman who have nothing better to do than creep on you and ring upstairs and downstairs to watch where I was?!They didn’t realise I was watching there every move including phone calls and eye signalling towards me.To bad I caught onto your extreme customer service creeping ways and threw everything back only to go to David Jones and purchase everything there.There was one lady in the fragrance area who was ever so helpful and passionate about what she sold, had mentioned I was looking for a present for my mothers 60th, her customer service alone sold me on the latest perfume.  I told her I had a few other places to visit whilst my baby was asleep, was bliss on my day off to browse around and I’d come back for her to wrap them which she was happy to do.I walked to the home fragrance area which my mother and I both adore and asked one particular sad soul for help (who was the lady that started this saga), because of the way I looked she immediately threw me into that category and proceeded to ignore me after asking for help.To the lovely lady in woman’s fragrance thank you!!! I am sorry you have to work with such twisted and delusional woman that no amount of make up will ever cover there flaws! Do not visit his store if you are not dressed to Myer standard, have a pram, no make up, messy bun and tanned skin because the customer service lacks in more ways than one.I work in sales and the woman in this store are way past there use by date! Where’s all the happy smiling and beautiful souls that live and breathe sales and customer service?? No wonder it’s always so dead!Lacking in everything!Worst experience ever!! Will never go back here again!"
Stuart Lingham,1,Where has all the service gone?,Bad,"Visited Myer Albury today to purchase a suit, shirt, tie etc. for my daughter’s upcoming wedding. With no offer of assistance we proceeded to self-serve by trying on suit jackets and walking between the fitting rooms and the suit racks to try on different items. Still no offers of assistance. We then moved to selecting a shirt, tie and belt. Again, little interest from the few staff in the vicinity. Finally, we proceeded to the service desk to pay for our armful of merchandise. The staff member who served us was pleasant enough but gave little outside processing the transaction. We left Myer feeling bewildered by our experience, lamenting the days when Myer’s customer service was the best in the business."
Dona Munasinghe,1,I would like to say how wonderful it…,Excellent,"I would like to say how wonderful it was today to have such a great customer service from your team member"" Yalem "" at Myer Fountain Gate.  She was very kind, polite, helpful with price checking patiently and most importantly serving with a smiley face every time.  Always I love to see her no fuss at all.  Thank you Yalem for your loyal service I greatly appreciate it at all times."

She was very busy both times but handled the situation fantastic ! What a lovely lady with a nice natural personality. I like to give credit where credit due as I worked for MYER at Southland for over 20 year so I could could totally relate ..keep up the good work Liza .
Karren Sheldon Stoneham,1,Need more staff in Geelong.,Bad,"Need more staff in Geelong.Although the two staff members they did have were serving one customer while five others waited to be served. Poor customer service, long waits. Losing customers"

Michael  Bell,2,What a fantastic experience at Myer…,Excellent,What a fantastic experience at Myer today. I've had the need get several pairs of shoes for my growing children the past 12 months and simply keep going back to Myer at Pacific Werribee. There's a lady called Patty and she is just great to deal with. Always a smile and a laugh. She measures the kids up and makes it so easy. Just a pleasure to deal with. Regards Mike.
Peter Cipo-lla,1,Disgusting service from Myers Curcus online,Bad,"I’m just going to say what happened and make up your own mind if it’s satisfactory. We bought some Kitchen tea presents from a registry 1.5 weeks ago and after multiple calls for the whereabouts of the merchandise, it is now the Thursday evening before the weekend of the kitchen tea and still no delivery. No staff can lie straight in bed. If our online business was run like the Myers circus we wouldn’t have a business. We have now been told to go and pick it up at a local Myers. Anyone doing any sort of registry with this circus of a company run right away they will disappoint your guests and the frustration may end you up without a gift."
Pearl,2,I would like to say how wonderful it…,Excellent,I would like to say how wonderful it was today to have such great customer service from your team member Lynda at Myer Chadstone. She was so helpful and kind. I called in to return a French Connection jacket I bought from your Myer city store on Saturday as it was to small and I said your store does not have my size but the French Connection store at Chadstone has my size. She offered to go and get it exchanged instead of me doing so.  I told her I would wonder around the ladies department whilst I waited. She then looked for me and said it’s all done. Your receipt and jacket is in the bag.  What lovely service from her with a smile. Thank you Lynda.
LORRAINE LAVEA,1,Worst customer service,Bad,"Worst customer service, worst online shopping experience I have ever had,It’s sad that Myer backed by big naked Brand’s can’t get the most important skill right, I ordered stuff online understandably since it was three days ago it wouldn’t be ready to pick up on the second day An order placed on Monday and by Wednesday I understand it wouldn’t be ready but what I don’t understand is the level of customer service I got when I was so desperate to try to see if they  could find a way for me to even go a different store to get my order, it was one no after another I’ve worked in retail for 20 years and one thing I know you must do is try and go out of way to see what you can do for the customer.Bottom line never will I ever shop at Myers again"
jill Margaria,1,I was shopping at your Morley galleria…,Excellent,"I was shopping at your Morley galleria store today, was served by Agata, your David Lawrence staff member. I was given excellent and friendly service by her, she al had great product knowledge and I ended up buying 2 items when I wasn't even looking to buy. she is an asset to your company and there should be more like her in Myer stores."
John,1,Visited Myer Chatswood today to change…,Bad,"Visited Myer Chatswood today to change some wrong fitting pants gifted by my wife. Said hello with a smile to the stone faced assistant and was greeted with an angry ""YES?!"" reply. The whole approach of this Myer sales assistant was confrontational. I asked if I could exchange the pants for the right size and it was if I had asked for her blood. Not one person working there knew where anything was.When you receive better service at a drive thru McDonalds you know something is wrong with a department store.I would never ever buy or visit their store again. Unpleasant, time consuming, horrible experience.Good luck when you go into receivership."
Christina Georgiadis,1,Exceptional customer service from Toni,Excellent,Today  I received  exceptional  customer service from a lovely  staff member  at Myer Tea Tree Plaza.  Her name  was Toni  she was so helpful  and spent  an hour with my daughter and myself  assisting us.  Thank you soo much Toni  you have  a natural  gift and your warmth  and customer service was amazing .  I wish you well  and look  forward  to shopping  again  at Myer !! Keep  up the great  work!!!
Anne Baillie,1,Dont buy online from Myer,Bad,Paid for a coffee machine and chose click and collect. Order stated that stock available at Sydney store.  Went to pick up - no coffee machine - no record of my order - no email explaining - they have debited my credit card.  Myer Online = Take your money and dont give you what you paid for.  Ashamed your Australian.
MGN,1,Unsafe shopping area,Bad,"Went to Myer Garden City in WA on Sunday, 17th March 2019. One of the wooden shelf fell on my foot. Fortunately there was no bone fracture but my foot was bruised and swollen. First aider came to help. The floor manager only cared about filling in the incident report.No follow up or compensation were offered to me since then."
G-Shocker,1,Myer Bourke Street - good luck buying a G-Shock Watch,Bad,"Myer Bourke Street: Myer keeps talking about stores offering experiences rather then just buying stuff but the experience with Myer’s G-Shock watch counter is a bad one. Literally every time I go in there the staff member is on the phone chatting or wandering around other areas of the store. Good luck trying to buy a G-Shock watch or even try one on. I have been in maybe 20 times over the last 6 months and all you can do is wander around looking at the G-Shocks in their sealed glass cabinets because he’s standing there with his back to the area on the phone. He looks the part; funky dressed and wearing a cap but you can’t even get in his eyeline as he’s huddled over the register facing a wall, on the phone. I’ve toyed with the idea of grabbing the keys from under the register when he’s off chatting at other counters just so I could have a look at a watch. At least I can get an idea of size and look for when I go and buy online which is a better experience than Myers’s experience. I’d love to know whether he’s a Myer employee or working for Casio. I assume the latter as he probably doesn’t have a manager who can check in on him. Otherwise I think there might be better customer service."
Nina Gilmour,3,I have visited Myer Bourke Street - The Ordinary,Bad,"I have visited Myer Bourke Street, Melbourne many times and most times have had no issues, however, each time, in the last few months  I have visited and bought products from The Ordinary - Deciem counter, the service has been flat, obnoxious and rude. Each time there has been a lady at the counter, three times two different women, both with the same obnoxious attitude. I can easily buy these products from the Chapel street store where I have had fantastic service. Not sure who is getting training there, but they should learn a few things about customer service."
Varold,2,I love shopping at Myer!,Excellent,"I have used many forms of shopping at Myer - online delivery, click and collect and in store. Never had any problems, always quick and easy. I love their products, the quality and they have fantastic sales."
Wallart pops,3,Have been looking for some really…,Bad,"Have been looking for some really special shoes to wear with a vintage style lace dress I bought to wear to a wedding. Went on Iconic and they had a few nice ones but were not quite right so thought I'd give Myer online a try. O. M. G... the shoes they had were like something a seventy yr old with bunions would buy from the chemist. Ugliest, most boring shoes I have ever seen. Seen better styles in Spendless. From memory the last time I was in the store looking for clothes they weren't much better. Whomever they have purchasing stock should be fired immediately and replaced with someone who actually knows something about fashion and current trends. No wonder they're going broke. Myer used to be a great department store but now they're just old and stale. Selling the same old labels and designers that have been around for decades. Shame."
Steve,1,In store today looking for a suit and …,Poor,"In store today looking for a suit and  must admit was very disappointed with the service. Most times, either no one was there, or when they were they didn't even bother to serve you. If you were the next aisle over to there little fithdom, you didn't matter. Thanks to those who did, pity stock is so poor, no sizes were available. Signs with further 25% off suits were vague and no one could advise when and where they applied....crap service Myers, just crap"
Rosemary Crossley,1,Go to Myer if you need help from…,Excellent,"Go to Myer if you need help from skilled staff.  I need special bras and special shoes.  Both departments in the Bourke Street store have knowledgeable, helpful and gracious staff.  Today when I said ""I need shoes just like the old ones I'm wearing."" the assistant  said ""Ah, they're Bounce.  Sadly they're not made any more.  The closest replacement is Nature"" and produced 2 sizes, one of which fitted perfectly.   Our recent Myer experiences have all been fun, with friendly assistants, comfy chairs for my partner to sit in while I try things on, and better outcomes than shopping on-line.  I couldn't find 'Bounce' shoes on line, and had no way of knowing 'Nature' was the best replacement.  Same with bras - the brand and size I needed wasn't findable anywhere on line, but an assistant tracked it down in the store, even in my preferred colour.  I bought all they had!And there's Brunetti's for coffee...."
Danny O’Neill,1,Presumption of guilt.,Bad,"Tonight the 7th of February 2019 will be the last time I ever purchase anything in a Myer Store. I was shopping with my two Daughters at Cairns Central Myer and after purchasing $200 worth of clothing we went to get both of my Daughters some Perfume. One of my Daughters had selected the one she liked and we were walking around looking for one for my other Daughter when one of the shop assistants started yelling out “ excuse me” I heard her but didn’t take much notice because why would she be yelling at me. Anyway I stopped and looked and it was me she was yelling at, she then said to me “ we like people to purchase the goods before leaving the store Sir”. So I put the $180 bottle of Perfume on the display next to me and said goodbye. I cannot believe how rude she was yelling at me in front of other customers and she obviously presumed I was going to steal the Perfume I was holding in my hand. She didn’t even wait until I had left the area where the Perfume was being sold before she did this. I presume I wasn’t dressed to her standards on something stupid like that but I can guarantee I earn three times more than she does in a week and none of it will ever be spent in a Myer Store. RUDE."
Cathleen,1,Just don't shop online at Myer,Bad,"Just don't shop online at Myer. Customer service is terrible. They me sent the wrong item & their only solution is for me to take it into a store or take to Australia Post for return. They refused to send me what I actually paid for until the item they sent in error was returned. The item I ordered was then out of stcok. Beware that when Myer make mistakes that are 100% their fault...the onus is 100% on the custom to fix it. Was told this by unhelpful customer service - ""it's their policy & available on their website"".Any wonder they are going broke...the retail sector is dying and they have no ability to complete with the customer service of credible online retailers."
Marnie,3,No wonder shareholders are annoyed; Myer bites the big one,Bad,"I really do appreciate great customer service from a store that leaves you showering the sales person with 'thank yous' and a smile when you leave.  Alas this is not so at Myer.  The staff seem to think that they work at some sort of 5 star store that only the very well to do are appreciated.  Every time I have been to the Galleria Morley store I have never left disappointed at some snotty staff member who obviously has better things to do. Today I went to the shoe department hunting for some boots for winter. However I got to stand at the counter waiting and waiting and waiting for the woman to get off her personal phone call (on the company phone by the way) only to be met with a look of 'thanks for interrupting me' on her face.  She couldn't help me with what I wanted and told me to go to another store.  Now normally I am not a rude person, but I was really ticked at this stage so I looked at her and walked off without saying a word (and big surprise she wasn't wearing a name tag, so I don't know who I am talking about).On another occasion In the lingerie section (I was only there once and that was enough) I asked a lady if they had more of a specific item in stock that I wanted and she just pointed to the shelves and said 'no that's it'.  Excellent!Or how about one morning where myself and quite a few others were standing at the doors waiting for them to open (it was 9.10am) when the lady bringing them up motioned with her hands that we weren't allowed inside yet.I don't believe it's just shopping sites that is killing off Myer it's their wonderful caring staff that are pulling the plug to let this department store go down the gurgler! Oh and I agree with the (I think he is a major shareholder, he spoke of Myers problem a few months ago) that inside the store the dim lighting really does make it look like a MORGUE!"
JOHN KULCZYCKI,2,Haven't things changed in our once…,Average,"Haven't things changed in our once great store from staff falling over themselves to assist you to no one, well the experience I had, I did notice one female staff member but she was busy chatting away with friends she had seen in the store. Honestly I walked and it was like no one works here except for make up. Sadly my wife tells me this is the norm, I beg to differ as our local at Liverpool the staff are as they were  helpful. Don't know what has happened at Pacific Fair."
Jen Garnet,1,Myer Online,Bad,"Myer Online - forget it!Stock levels are wrong.They won't honour in-store pricing.No live or online help (not even email) - in a 1960s move from Myer you have to phone them within office hours to get a response.Ordered something online shown as in stock.  Days and days later get a notification it's out of stock and they'll refund you.Absolutely hopeless; 3 out of 4 items I wanted to buy showed as in stock and then either said out of stock in basket, or I got the dreaded cancellation email.NEVER AGAIN Myer Online, never ever again. Waste of time, phone calls, patience, effort. All that time and effort and ended up with NOTHING!"
Bill,7,Disgusted!,Bad,"Wasted my time and money. Placed an order at the Box Hill store to pick up from the CBD store which is a fair distance from my place of residence. When I arrived to collect the item 2 days later I was told no stock and that they would be glad to offer me a refund?! Wasted close to 2 hours for a product that they didn’t have. Only received an email a day after I went that they didn’t have the products! “Customer service” offers $10 for compensation. What a joke?!! Never ever again, will I shop at Myers."
Sue Sue,4,Pleasantly Surprised :-),Great,"After all the horrible comments I had read 'after' I placed an online order with MYER, I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the order delivery and both email and SMS updates on it's status !!!It has been an exceptionally pleasant experience.I still think their website desperately needs updating as compared to the last time I ever placed an order online; it has fallen behind the competitors dramatically and is much harder to navigate than it used to be.I virtually had to type in what I wanted in SEARCH as browsing via menus just didn't produce any results !!"
Silvia Cicciarella,1,Where is the customer service,Bad,"Wanting to buy a suit for my son we visited Myer Melbourne, thinking we would receive good knowledgeable service - very disappointing. After walking around for ages being totally ignored, we proceeded to try on various suit jackets in the middle of the department but still no service. There were staff around, some busy talking to each other while others sat at laptops completely oblivious. We eventually moved to the fitting rooms to try on trousers, thinking there would be someone helpful there, but alas, nobody. Even while I went back and forth from the fitting rooms seeking different sizes for my son to try..... nothing, no acknowledgment, nothing!!! After an hour or so of roaming around the department and about to give up, one gentlemen, obviously returning from a break, took off his jacket without any hesitation and proceeded to find pants, shirt, tie and pocket square to match a jacket we had selected. Jacob from Aquila you are a star!! You did not hesitate to assist even though we had not selected an Aquila jacket. If it were not for you we would have left with nothing. Not only did you save us from another shopping trip but you were pleasant, helpful and made the whole experience pleasurable. $400 later, I have a happy teenager and a free weekend. Thank you Jacob, keep up the great work. To all the others working on the floor tonight, you do not deserve your jobs - bloody useless. Myer - your reputation of great customer service is shot. It’s little wonder your sales and profits are down, lift your game and bring back the Myer of old."
Justin,3,Where is the customer service??,Bad,"Went to Myer Garden City, WA to inquire about price match for purchased product. The staff was unhappy and denying all possibilities. Where is the customer service? Don't think I deserve such treatment by being a customer. Wish I could turn back the clock and never step into Myer."
Debra Casey,1,If I could give higher I would.,Excellent,"If I could give higher I would.We spent this morning in Myer Northland in the ladies wear section.To say Linda in ladies wear and Silvana in lingerie were amazing is not sufficient.Stunningly polite, capable, patient.My mum was over the moon.Thank you Myer.Brilliant customer service.Debra"
Karen walker,1,I ordered shoes for a function mid jan…,Bad,I ordered shoes for a function mid jan 2019 using after pay....so far i have payed 3 payments totalling  $150 with no shoes a month and a half later!! Called them 3 times abd eventually cancelled order. Another 2 calls still waiting on refund.  Again told today money would be refunded hasn't happened! Totally unprofessional and zero customer service.  Also funny how you cant write a complaint to myers website?? Next step ombudsman! ! Absolutely pathetic! !
Yee,1,IT WAS THE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I NEVER HAD.,Bad,"Myer city of Melbourne the one call Eric from Taiwan, he did a worset service ,  no greeting no smile, not even say hello. RUSH in service,  when I asked how to modify the length of the watch, then he said if you going to purchase it and show me the arrogant face, once I said yes he did modify it, and asked me to paid for it immediately. The whole process took under two minutes, What he rushing for, to chats with other staffs again or finishing his shift.after I paid, I asked him “am I being difficult, why you acting like this?”He told me I do what do you ask. It sounds like what else do you want, I did served . Hey, Am I being difficult, you not show me any hospitality? And I don’t feel welcome in here. he putted everything in a box and wrap up a plastic bag left it on table and step out. This kind of shopping experience even worst then supermarket, very bad attitude in service industry, Don’t let one staff Ruining yours band , you a one of the big company in Australia, should show everyone professional service attitude, you are losing customer loyalty and Company reputation."
Connie SueSee,1,Excellent service,Excellent,I ordered an S pen and it was exactly what I wanted and I received it next day.Super impressed with the service.
Shalini,1,Customer Service -Estee Lauder department chermside store14/02/19,Bad,I went to buy make up from Estee Lauder. The lady serving in that department took good 15 minutes just talking to the previous customer.She finally told me she will be with me soon. She finished with the previous cutomer and went straight to the lady who had just entered the store and started serving her. After a couple of minutes she asked me if i knew what products i was after .I told her yes however i needed help. She said nothing and  continued to attend to the other customer!. I worked out and went to David Jones . Dont go to Myer Chermside  if you have dark skin.
Sandra Youssef,1,Excellent service by Sophia,Excellent,I was thrilled today to be served by Sophia on the Dior counter at Myer Parramatta today. Her customer service was excellent. Exceptionally pleasant to deal with.Thank you
Luisa Mastro,1,I just received the best costumer…,Excellent,I just received the best costumer service in Dior perfumes department !!!! I was assisted by a guy called Harrison who really helped me find out what I was looking for!! Really happy with my purchase !
Elizabeth Chen,1,Avoid Myer Market,Bad,"Avoid buying anything from the Myer Market! I returned an item via Myer Eastland on the 9th Jan, and still waiting for my refund nearly a month later. Apparently Myer needs to send the item back to the seller - in this case Cherub Baby Australia - wait for the seller to confirm receipt, and then let the seller organise the refund. But now no one seems to know where the item is between Myer and the seller! No one is taking responsibility, even though in their returns policy they say that Myer will ensure the returned item gets sent back to the seller. I keep calling Myer and the seller - the former keeps saying their look into and call me back, and the latter never answers the phone an their message service is too full for them to accept any new messages. It’s a debacle."
Andrea Goode,1,Thank you Belinda,Excellent,"Today I was helped by the most amazing & caring consultant at Indooroopilly Myers beauty section. Belinda helped me to find a very suitable gift for my niece after I had walked every floor of Indooroopilly. She listened to me, understood what I was looking for & then put together the best Lancome present with extra samples. I walked away feeling so grateful for her wonderful & caring assistance. Thank you so much Belinda, you went above & beyond any other store I walked into. So grateful."
Liz Oluwi,1,"do not order online they take money for out of stock items, fail to inform they are out of stock for days",Bad,"do not order online. Extremely shoddy service. I ordered a coffee maker that was on sale that week online on Saturday from Myer. I saw it was available in multiple stores just not the ones near to me when I placed the order. I received confirmation of the order after paying $588 for the Breville Barista Expresso maker in cranberry. They also had the stainless steel one in stock and it was on sale too but for a slightly higher price. But I wanted the cranberry one anyway. By Thursday I had not received notification that it was going to be sent out so I phoned up. The operator informed me that they had difficulty sourcing it but she had phoned up and checked and it was now at Chatswood and she had sent a mail message to send it out immediately and I should hear the next day. Friday no notification so I phone up again. I got a really nice operator who to her credit tried to help me, shame head office let her down. Firstly, there was no item in stock the woman yesterday had misinformed me. Secondly although they knew it was not available no-one had informed me. So for an item that they should have figured out was not available in one day and informed me straight away, they still had not informed me and only did because the operator took time to check what was happening  (that phone call took 40 minutes). They kept my money for days and if I had not phoned up again they still would not have informed me. Now I have to wait the weekend plus 3 business days to get my $588 back which they will earn interest on. The lovely receptionist said she could see this was not acceptable and said that they had the stainless steel version in stock and would I like that one instead since they should honour the price I paid. Head office then phoned me up. NO they would not honour the price since the stainless steel model was now no longer on sale and now was valued at $949. Now had they refunded me my money straight off I would have been able to buy a stainless steel version from Bing Lee for $649. That's $62 more than the $588 I paid. But Myers for the sake of $61 (because I can ask them to price match and they should do that it says in their terms and conditions) have lost another customer People should know  that they can order online and Myer keep a vast amount of money for days earning interest on it and not informing customers the item is out of stock. It should have taken 1 day at most to find out that item was not in stock at any store and inform me. I have read many other people had same problem. I think it is a scam where they earn interest on money for days by not informing people that the item is not in stock. They should not take any money until they have shipped it. Seriously dodgy"
Kirsty Hunter,1,Amazing customer service,Excellent,"I shopped for bra's in the Pitt Street Mall Myer today. I was served by a lovely lady called Lara. By the time i found a suitable bra to fit, i counted 13 coat hangers. The 30% sale was on and it was lunch time, so it was extremely busy but Lara kept persisting to find a bra that was the correct fit. Can you please pass on my thankyou's to Lara."
Keren Huck,1,Karen Nielson served my daughter and I…,Excellent,"Karen Nielson served my daughter and I in the lingerie department at Myer Garden City, on our quest for bras. She was efficient, very personable, extremely helpful and was able to find items that fitted and looked great. We had a happy shopping experience with her, and that is not always the case when bra shopping. Thank you, Karen"
Mark Pitcher,1,Online service unnaccaptable,Bad,Online service unnaccaptable . Purchased soda stream online- 10 days later received email that the purchase had been cancelled and my money had been refunded.  Waited 20 mins for customer phone customer service who politely informed me that they had run out of stock.  I informed him that in my considerable experience of purchasing online that in such cases the company had always given me the choice of refund or to wait for the new stock or an alternative item to honour the deal.  He informed that this was not Myer policy- He was unable to hand me on to someone who may be able to assist further and when i checked the website found there was no place to make a complaint of offer written feedback. Have been loyal customer for 20 years and will no longer purchase from Myer. There are plenty of alternatives. I will not support an institution that is disinterested in feedback from customers. I urge others to do the same  -  money talks.  Myer- tyrants!!
Annette,1,Hi this morning I went to high point…,Excellent,Hi this morning I went to high point and I had to return a bra that was faulty.  The sales lady I think her name was Cláudia was truly amazing.  Not only did she agree with me that the bra was faulty but she proceeded to help me buy and fitted me with another better bra.  As I said she was amazing.  She then proceeded to give me the direct line to her area.  It was by far the best service I’ve ever had at high point.  Thanks heaps Claudia.
Lorraine,1,"MYER Miranda, rude and lazy customer service",Bad,"For one year I’ve been ignored by the rude customer service lady who works in the Proactive, Trilogy, Revlon section in MYER Miranda. I can stand right next to her and she simply turns her back and pretends to be busy. Today I stood at her counter (I was her only customer) and she wouldn’t even look up. So I had to ask the back of her head if I could purchase my lotions and she eye rolled me, huffed and puffed and showed how annoyed she was that she had to actually serve a customer. She was rude, arrogant and didn’t ask for my Myer One card. She could see I wasn’t happy with her and said “sorry to keep you waiting for so long” which shows she knew I had been standing there. I’ve contacted MYER through feedback several times and they do nothing. I’m now contacting my bank to cancel my MYER Rewards and switching to another chain. Miserable and lazy customer service."
Ti,1,Enjoyed lovely customer service from Rey,Excellent,Enjoyed lovely customer service from Fey at the Bondi store.  Happily taking and holding the clothes we intended to try on until we were ready.  Then assisting when we required it with a polite and happy nature.... so nice to have some customer service once again.
R,4,Liar Liar,Bad,"Myer lies to its customers. Purchased two items online. I get them to find out they are made out of cheap material (NOT the materials advertised online). Immediate return plus a nasty email :)Used up the rest of my gift card in store (where I could see the product and know they are not lying to me ;) ) and will not ever shop there again! Good job, Myer!"
Sian Rickard,3,Myer- Hopeless Customer Service,Bad,"Myer- Hopeless Customer ServiceI bought 11 items in Boxing Day sale and the money was debited from my account immediately.Some of the items arrived in dribs and drabs and I was appalled that instead of sending 1 plastic bag with all the items in it, I received multiple plastic bags...hideous for the environment.Today 10/1/19 I tried to contact them on their 13 number to find out where the remaining 2 items are (that I have paid for) and had to abandon the call after being on hold for 20 minutes. If you don't have the items in stock then please refund my money.There is apparently no other way to contact the business.My order Number is 1055929266.NOT GOOD ENOUGH MYER. Pull your finger out and start providing better customer service.Definitely will not buy anything online with them again"
Emma,8,Shocking is about the most generous word I can use,Bad,"Ordered an item online. Got confirmation and advised would get email and SMS when dispatched.  Money taken from account moment order placed.  Then nothing - followed up on a number of occasions - only way in writing seems to be by facebook messenger, eventually I get someone who might know what is happening who tells me they don't have the item.  This is 11 days after placing the order!  So now waiting for a refund.  I would have bought at David Jones when they had it had I known how shambolic Myer are.  If you don't have something, don't sell it, it really is very simple.  Will NEVER order from these guys again and will avoid their store now too.  Trust - lost!"
Allan Holmes,2,I purchased a breville dual boiler…,Excellent,I purchased a breville dual boiler coffee machine which was faulty. Myer took it back and sorted out its replacement very quickly. Fast service and quick resolution

Sandra Hamilton,1,I had some gift card 20th Dec 2018 Myer City,Bad,"I had some gift card - 2 from Woolworths Group and one from Myer, for 250 dollarsunfortunately my wallet was stolen just after i had done a purchase at the Lancome counter in the Sydney city store for perfume - my purchase was 155 which left me 95.so story goes Woolworths Group cards were gone as well -BUT Woolworths Gift Card dept asked  me where the last transactions were and how much they were and the Balance on the receipt ,LIKE MAGIC - i received 2 new cards with the same balance amount.........how lovely.  Myer policy is that it is like money so no show. Yes i know it is my responsibility but I did not want my wallet stolen.I will now get Woolworths Gift Cards from now on."
HN,1,"Bad experience with in-store purchase and delivery, and poor attitude at MYER Hub",Bad,"I recently had a bad experience at MYER Chatswood but some of the issues I mention below are probably not specific to this centre. I bought a pair shoes on NYE (2018) but because the colour I liked wasn't available in store at the time, the retail assistant offered for them to be delivered to my home address. So, I agreed (though I hesitated), PAID for the shoes in store and provided my address for delivery. Unfortunately, when Capital Transport tried to deliver them I was not at home. They didn't leave a card behind like most delivery companies do (like Toll), but I did get calls from them about the delivery attempt. I suggested to try to re-deliver the next day and gave them time intervals at which I will be at home. But they said they can't do that and that they would have to return the shoes to MYER. The lady from Capital Transport said on the phone that they would return them to MYER Macquarie but I told them to instead return the shoes to MYER Chatswood, where I bought them. She agreed and confirmed that this is what they'd do.My wife and I then tried to call MYER Chatswood Menswear/Underwear and shoes section but found it very hard to reach, either nobody was picking up or it seems like it was picked up but then become instantly disconnected. We did eventually reach someone who tried to help but ultimately he didn't seem to know whether they'd received the shoes back from Capital and whether we could collect them. He seemed clueless about what to do in this case.Finally, we just went to the store to the Menswear/Shoes section and explained the situation. They advised us to go to the MYER Hub on the sixth floor. At the MYER Hub, I showed the receipt for the shoes and patiently explained what had happened, but the customer service representative treated my wife and I with suspicion saying that what I had was not a delivery receipt, but a purchase receipt. But that's all that we received when we bought and PAID for the shoes, and Capital did not leave behind a note, as I noted above. Anyway, the representative also could not determine what had happened to the shoes, so I asked whether I could just get a refund for them. Because there was a queue building up behind us, another representative was called to assist us. The second representative came and immediately started to process a refund without asking for an explanation. I was asked to insert a card in order to get the refund. As I did that I was not looking at the card machine as it asked for my pin. She treated me with contempt as if my wife and I were common criminals and made a snarky comment along the lines of ""take your time as we are being nice waiting for you to put in your pin"". Instead of that comment she could have simply reminded me politely that I needed to type in my pin.Anyway, the message is if you are in store and the product that you want is not there at the time of purchase but can be stocked-in and delivered to you, it's better to simply not buy it. Nobody there at MYER Chatswood seems to know about this kind of delivery and if you are unfortunate to not be at home at the delivery attempt then you may find yourself going through the unpleasant experience my wife and I did as narrated above, especially the poor customer service we experienced."
Greta Caneva,2,Pricing!,Bad,"The star rating is not necessarily for the customer service, but the pricing. How can there such a big price difference between Myer and their direct competition David Jones. Original price on same item $10 difference and with SALE discounts DJs was $35.97 whilst Myer was $41.97, quite a difference when you buy multiples.The manager offered to match as close as possible, but couldn't because of the original price and the % that would be allowed. DJs had a small salad spinner for $59.95 plus the 30% discount, same salad spinner at Myer was $89.95. How can that be? Wrong pricing? The staff if you found any were friendly, but their pricing requires much attention if they wish to retain customers like myself who were once loyal!"
Maryanne Conte,1,Great start to 2019 NOT.,Bad,"Great start to 2019 NOT! 4th of Jan walked in to the level 4 to purchase a quilt cover in a great mood till I asked a staff member for assistance .. with no one  in site the sales lady  says I'm busy so abruptly that I decided to find my own quilt cover and not bother her... I then go to pay and she is serving another customer which is perfectly normal till she finishes with the customer and picks up the phone and walks off..  go figure! No explanation no nothing. I go to put the quilt back as there is no way in hell im giving Myer my money when she start talking to another staff member about how rude customer are and how she doesn't have to take it.. not a worry that customers are hearing her opinion about customers that pay her wage. The only regret I have is not getting her name, there were two ladies behind the counter one had blonde short hair.. she was lovely and the other with the attitude had dark hair. Never returning to Myer again. Thanks for great customer service.. NOT! Yet another unhappy customer not returning."
Sue Scott,1,Deserve to go under!,Bad,"I just did a bit of post Christmas shopping and I have made the decision NEVER to enter Myer ever again! The sales girl could not have been less interested or helpful and lost a sale of $200 when I took my business to David Jones. Train your staff to show some enthusiasm. When I pointed out the hosiery was on sale at DJ's she shrugged and walked off, no attempt to price match or check on prices. Not good enough Myer!"
Zoe Liu,1,"The lady named Samantha in Elizabeth Arden is unbelievably rude and racist, please stop ruining people’s life and quit the job!",Bad,"I was doing Christmas shopping for families and friends, and I bought one of the cream gift set in Elizabeth Arden around 12 noon. I told the lady I will give it to them later today so I don’t need the receipt. However it was a replicated gift, therefore I went back there around 2pm wished for a refund so I could get them something else. The lady served me in the morning was there too. Apparently she recognised me from earlier, but she told me she could not give me the refund without the receipt, and i told her that if she could check the system and pull out the transaction so she could do the refund. And This particular one Samantha, came out from the staff room and asked what’s going on, and when she knew she was like we can’t do anything if you don’t have the receipt. And the other lady said I already chuck it in the bin. And they were just standing there starring at me. I repeated myself and emphasised I just purchased few hours ago, and I would like a refund. Then Samantha said something that I would never forget: “Do you wanna go through the bin to find your receipt?” When she processed the refund at the end, she just throw the cash to me, and gave me that disgusted look in her eyes, and all of them starring at while I left the store.I don’t think this is about professionalism, this is ethical and racist issue regarding staff working there. I would hope to have reply about how you would take care of the issue.NEVER SHOP THERE EVER AGAIN!"
Mim roe,3,I ordered a Christmas gift for my…,Bad,"I ordered a Christmas gift for my mother in Australia I live in the UK I ordered it with delivery.  They took the money on the 17th of December and then emailed me on the 26 December that they had cancelled the order.  My Mother has been unwell this year she is 70 and I had wanted to spoil her instead, she had no gift from me on Christmas.  I’m so unbelievably angry, it’s hard to put into words.  I didn’t even get the chance to organise anything else due to their late cancellation."
Helen Bauer,1,Fanni in the Mimco Myer department in…,Excellent,"Fanni in the Mimco Myer department in Wahringah Mall was exceptionally helpful. She actually got it that buying the bag my daughter loved in the wrong colour is a big, big issue for a 13 year old. The tears we had Christmas Eve were forgotten once she got the right bag! Thank you Fanni and your team leader to really understand your customers and get out of your way to help and make them happy!"
Jan L,1,"Myer, please train your staff better or just put up a sign to say 'the shiseido worker will arrive at ____ today'",Bad,"I had a very unpleasant experience at Myer Parramatta (27.12.18, around 11 am) with the lady working at the Dior counter. I, along with 2 other customers were waiting for service at the Shiseido counter. The nearest person working was a lady at the adjacent beauty counter, Dior. She was with a customer (2 ladies who were together). 10 minutes went by, one customer at Shiseido left. I waited until the 2 Dior customers were speaking to each other to ask the Dior/Myer worker if someone was on Shiseido. I was polite and said 'excuse me, could you please tell me if there is someone working on Shiseido' to which she replied 'she will be in later today, can you not see I am in the middle of a conversation'. Because of this, I went to David Jones. Same situation, yet the customer handling was 100 times better. The DJs worker not only said to wait a moment but also directed the customer to someone who could help. I ended up buying more than I intended at David Jones, even though Myer had 10% off Shiseido. Shame on you Myer, train your staff to use basic manners - a simple 'I will be with you in a moment' will have sufficed."
Jan Lawless,1,I have given the customer service 4…,Great,"I have given the customer service 4 stars because , even in the chaotic first hour of the sale the staff were wonderful . However , whoever set up the computer did not take into account that some items were 60% off not 50% . When I arrived home and checked my docket I discovered that the Maxwell & Williams platters I had purchased were charged at 50% and not 60% . That was most annoying as now I have to travel back to Maroochydore to get a refund . With petrol prices the way they are , and living 30 minutes drive away , that is not a cheao process . So ....I encourage everyone to check their dockets . Computers/machines are not as reliable as a real living human !"
Murray Wilkinson,1,I attended the Boxing Day sale at Myer at Pacific Fair,Great,"I attended the Boxing Day sale at Pacific Fair and specifically the Ralph Lauren and Rodd and Gunn sales. I am writing to comment on the excellent service I received from the Rodd and Gunn representative - Toni Arron, who provided both advice and service in what was to say the least a fast paced environment. The service and customer care was excellent and with people like that, Rodd and Gunn have a bright future."
Rachael Zelley,1,No gift cards allowed at boxing day sales???,Bad,"Boxing day sales today, and told at the Ballarat store that they are not accepting their own gift cards to pay for purchases today? Apparently their system wasnt working, yet everything else was working, eft etc. This was at 2pm today. Surely if something had gone wrong they had plenty of time to fix it. But not allowing people to use gift cards they had received for christmas at their own sales is ridiculous."
Sandy Higgins,1,Came back recently from australia and…,Great,Came back recently from australia and was suprisingly impressed with the service here!!
Dee,2,Disappointing customer service.,Bad,"Was shopping for a christmas present at Myer Westfield Doncaster 23/12/2018 @ around 3pm. Stood at Clinique counter. 2 sales persons  were there. One was looking down and doing some paper work. The other looked at me , no smiles, no courtesy ""I'll be with you soon"".There was a another customer deciding on a product. She could have easily acknowledged me. She kept looking at me but didn't respond at all. Finally when the person decided she served her. By that time another lady came and few mins later another one came and stood behind us. We were not in a line. There was no room. I was the closest and the 2nd one stood a bit back to the left and 3rd one stood back sort of between. Suddenly the one who was doing paper work lifted her head and asked ""who's next"". I approached the counter. She looked at the 3rd customer and said ""I think you were first""and started serving. I was speechless. She had no idea who came first but automatically assumed that I crashed the line and lied to get served first ???? Then the other one finished her serving and asked ""who's next"" even though she clearly saw me waiting for about 10 mins now. I approached the counter again. She looked at the other customer and said ""you are first "" Then the customer said ""no this lady was first"" Then the sales person reluctantly looked at me and finally responded. She went back to find the product and came back in a flash and said""Sorry sold out. Check at David Jones"" I checked online and it was available in store.I checked it today and it's still available. Obviously these sales people pick and chose who they want to serve. Bit of ""pretty women attitude""? I could have easily did click and collect but I went there because I was in the store. I bought it from David Jones. I shop at Myer for about 30 years now. I came across few of these disrespectful customer service along the way. Very disappointed."
Andrea Cullen,1,I was treated poorly at Myers Toowoomba…,Bad,I was treated poorly at Myers Toowoomba today by two ladies working in the frangrance department. I was snatched from when I went to walk into a neighbouring section with a perfume I wanted to buy. I was basically accused of steeling without them actually saying it.Not to mention the intense security who weren't inconspicuous at all scattered all around the place.I am all for security and them protecting their goods but I felt like a criminal which I am not! I'm not happy with how I was treated. Thankfully the manager of the fragrance department was professional and also sympathetic to my experience with the two ladies.
A B Burton,2,I would like to commend Marianne at…,Excellent,"I would like to commend Marianne at Myer Carindale who served us in Ladies Underwear today. She was friendly, patient and totally professional in her treatment of my elderly Mum and myself. It's service like this that wins over online shopping for me!Thank- you!Andrea"
David Leo,2,"THANKS FOR RUINING CHRISTMAS, MYER!",Bad,"Don't purchase anything from MYER online. Worst consignment team ever! Purchased a watch on 9 Dec, got a confirmation on 11 Dec that the order will dispatch on the next day with a tracking number that does not work. Called customer service and was informed that a wrong tracking number was provided. Until today I still haven't received my item or a correct tracking number and Christmas is just around the corner.Asked to cancel the order but MYER can't do anything since the item is marked as ""delivered"" but unsure where. Customer service kept pushing the call to another day saying they'll respond but no answer. The item that I have paid for cannot be cancelled as my order is lost in transit and nothing can be done at all but to ""wait"". Thanks for ruining Christmas MYER! Shop online at MYER? NO! Thank you, NEXT!"
Kath,1,Myer pathetic customer service and click and collect,Bad,"Ordered a camera on click and collect Monday 17 December so I could have following day, Myers website falsely claiming you would have after 10am if ordered after 1pm day prior.  I deliberately picked city store as it claimed it was in stock.  Receiving no email, after spending 3 hours trying to get onto customer service on phone and waiting ages just to be kept being cut off, I got on to someone who simply said she could see it was being processed.  Wednesday, 19 December still hearing nothing despite supposed convenience of using click and collect and having item immediately, having not received email I rang and waited ages again as I wanted to cancel order.  Conveniently for them, they claimed it had now been processed, though no email received.  The man could care less and said he would resend email.  Still no email received and not in junk mail.  On Thursday I will make special journey into city to pick up, 4 days after ordered. Anything but convenient with broken arm and foot, when I could have gone into a local J B HiFi and gotten the same product at reduced price.  NEVER use their click and collect.  They lie regarding having items.  Not ready in 24 hours and pathetic no-caring customer service"
Rhi Rhi,1,If I could give a zero I would. Terrible instore and online,Bad,"If I could give a zero I would. I was trying to order a suit for my fiancé on the Myer website and there was a deal for Blaq whereby if you purchase the jacket and pants, you get a free waistcoat - perfect as my partner loves waistcoats. There were only two types of waistcoats and one didn’t have his size in the jacket so I picked the ones I wanted and the offer wasn’t being applied. I suspected someone had applied the wrong offer to the jacket as, even though the MATCHING waistcoat said the correct suit offer, the suit jacket was displaying an offer for “casualwear”. Tried calling the number on their website, made a few selections and got a couple of pre-recorded messages but when it came to actually speaking to someone, the line just mysteriously went blank. Tried a few more time and it was still the same results. There isn’t even an email address or a contact form on the website which is a complete joke! Your customer service instore is bad enough, it is not only disappointing but infuriating to see this translate online as well. In this day and age where even small companies can afford to provide an effective website with good customer service, there’s just no excuse for this subpar service. And you’re scratching your heads as to why you have billion dollar losses. Looks like I’ll be saying goodbye to my Myerone membership soon, not from cancellation but from you going down the toilet. Don’t even get me started on my experience when I tried to go into your store to make my purchase. Laughable."
sleeping_beutie,4,Ridiculous 30 day exhange policy,Bad,The strict 30 day return/exchange policy is a joke. Now am stuck with $100 worth of clothes that don’t fit my son still with tags & receipt. I went overseas same week i drove an hr to the store as that is my nearest so i couldn’t exchange within 30 days.What if you buy in advance for presents & it’s the wrong size? Logic is needed for this policy!

qinheshiye Qin,1,Myer store-  my Worst online shopping experience ever,Bad,"Myer store-  my Worst online shopping experience ever! 😰😰😰no wonder Myer stores are closing down!😔😔Last Thursday I went to buy a miss shop handbag for my sister in law’s birthday ( she sent me the photo of the bag) this Saturday. The lady at miss shop said there were three in store but she couldn’t find any of them. She suggested online shopping and guaranteed delivery on Monday which I thought was great idea. Monday evening about 8.45 pm I got text message from star track states they attempted deliver the bag at 8.45pm but couldn’t get into the building as our office building closes at 6pm( which is weird as I thought most delivery happens during business hours). 🤨I called star track on Tuesday and requested different delivery time of nearby post office drop, they declined.I went to Myer store in Eastland on Wednesday and being told by the stuff that they would request return the item to city store and I could just collect. Went to Myer city store today Friday and after talking to three different staffs then waited for nearly one hour, finally got the item. 😞Now at 10pm at home when I checked the bag, the strap was missing and label was cut off. 😩😩😩How am I going to give it to my sister in law this Saturday for her birthday 🎁?Myer shame one you and I’m sooooo disappointed 😔 😡😰😨No wonder your share is going down and stores are closing! I wouldn’t shop at Myer again! So are my families! 😨😩😔Ps I am also 35 weeks pregnant 🤰 and exhausted running around for this 😝😝"

DT,2,Don't get your hopes up.,Bad,"Myers online Click and Collect process is great, even as a guest shopper. You can click on something, select your local store to see if it's in stock, easily and securely pay for it, and are told an email and text will be sent when its ready. They will even send a survey out so you can tell them how easy it was. That's when it all goes bad. Firstly, no that item may not be in stock so you will have to wait.. and wait... and wait until it comes from who knows where. You can ring the 13 phone number and if it works and you speak to someone, chances are the computers are down so they cant help. You then ring the local store and if the phone is actually picked up by the store computer, have 2 choices, select 1 for opening hours or select 2 for a department. You don't get a customer service to select, you don't get a ""click and collect"" selection, you have to select a random department eg. Toys (even though you purchased eg perfume) and, if the phone doesn't ring out, apologise and ask for the ""click and collect"" person. And no, don't think you can complain to the store as there is no email address for any store online either, and my local store (Robina in QLD) doesn't even have a social media presence as a possible contact point either. And don't expect a further feedback survey on the ""click and collect"" experience as I am sure management already know how disappointing it is. Hugely disappointing for a brand apparently low on morale and service. And sadly, the staff are great, helpful and doing their best but are let down by other factors."
Rhiannon,1,Jigar Perth City Excellent,Excellent,"Jigar in electrical in Perth City is so beyond wonderful! Multiple experiences with him purchasing things and one product was faulty and he took time out of his own life to go to the BOSE warehouse to resolve the issue for us, not that he needed to or would get any work benefits from it he is just genuinely lovely. I always wait around to be served by him just because he is so great."
Jen Doe,1,Rude and racist customer service - Nita,Bad,"I was shopping in Myer Pitt Street Sydney today, was browsing in the women’s clothing brand ‘Seed Heritage’ section. Literally two minutes into my browsing/shopping, customer service assistant Nita from Seed Heritage said in a rude and awful tone “madam do not pull the clothing, please browse the clothing by touching the hangers” and as she was saying it she was showing the hand movement too. After she said that she walked away. I was still browsing and she came back from the change room with clothes in her arm, putting them back on the rack. She did not even try to acknowledge I was there or  made any eye contact. Um who shops clothing by touching the hangers? I was definitely not pulling. I’m Asian Australian, born and bred in Sydney. Nita was straight up rude. She had a racist undertone  and vibe about her, She did not even say “ hello how are you?”, “ can I help you” or even a “excuse me, sorry but if you don’t mind....”. Never shopping at Seed Heritage Myer again. Poor customer service. Will be putting a formal complaint. If anyone shops there in the future, be warned, Nita is straight up rude."
Kylie,1,I wont be going back to Myer!!!!,Bad,I wont be going back to Myer and definitely will not be using their online service.  I have been a loyal customer for 30 years but recently I have noticed the decline in the customer and today had yet another issue with click and collect.  I have attempted to buy the same product (on sale) three times in the past few months.   Today was the third time I had received the email telling me my item was ready for collection only to go there to be told it has not been in stock for months.   I was angry the second time this happened but now it has become comical.   How can such a large company allow this type of service to happen.

Dale Saliba,1,Home delivery,Bad,"I went into Myer in the city to purchase a Dyson v8 vacuum cleaner. There was one there but because I had to walk a mile back to the car, they said I could use home delivery for free. It would take 5 to 7 days. Perfect. Paid $600 and left. Eight days later no email regarding when going to be delivered. Rang their 13 number and was on hold for 30 min. I hung up. Recieved an email today telling me that there are no v8 in stock and to call them for a refund. I am fuming. I could of walked away 10 days ago with one and now ...... I phoned them again. Another half hour on the phone waiting. Customer service very poor. Poor guy on end of phone could only apologise. Never again Myer will I use your home delivery. There is no email to make a complaint and  13 number,  no one answers. Not happy Jan"
David Menara,9,Do not use their online service,Bad,"Do not use their online service! The myer family would be rolling in their graves. 7-10 business days 'assured' given we were going overseas for two months. We felt 20 days was enough, but no. 20 days later they sent the bag that came with our product but not the actual product (Dyson Hairdryer). Twice I tried to call them but twice I was on-hold for over thirty minutes. Sent two emails and nothing. We are now overseas and have received no notification of delivery. Really sad to see a great company collapse. Just don't bother as the reviews demonstrate. Give your money to a company that wants it!!!"

Who would pay $300 for something without inspecting the item!!!

Then I did not receive a tax invoice which I need for the warranty. I then spent over 40 minutes wait for customer assistance. I still have not received the tax invoice, so have started another phonecall-already over 20 minutes on hold, With the online store competition, Myer should be delivering better service-please hire some more well trained staff. I have been a customer for over 50 years and do expect better. Online shops have online chat facilities. When waiting on hold there is just silence like they have hung up and then a voice comes back. Just not a positive experience. I have never left a 1 star review before, but the service is so poor! Amazing now I have music....... after 15minutes-now the music has gone again-just crackles!. Point of sale is poor and after sales is poor."
Paul,1,Made an online purchase which  failed…,Bad,Made an online purchase which  failed but only after deducting the full $993 from my Myer card... Customer service told me to email an escalation team which have not acknowledge the email or replied after 4 days... No surprise Myer is going under when they can't even get an online order right and have terrible customer service. Guess I'll just go to the ombudsman/consumer affairs
Sour,1,I recently ordered an electronic item…,Bad,"I recently ordered an electronic item from Myer online during Black Friday sales. I thought it was a good deal and purchased the item. Expecting it to arrive and after a week later (when sales is over), I was informed that the item is out of stock and I will get a refund. If they have told me earlier, or even not accepting my order, I could have got it from somewhere else. But having accepting my order and not delivering is just not accepting in my point of view.I will not EVER EVER EVER trust Myer online EVER again. If they can't deliver, DO NOT PUT IT ONLINE. Myer no more. Bye bye to your royal customer. I'll go somewhere else."
Karen parsons,1,Myers.Congratulations !,Excellent,"Myers.Congratulations on having such a helpful polite sales person as Jerome in the kitchen appliance section of your store. I visited the store on Saturday at East Gardens and came back to make my purchases today. Jerome was very professional, knowledgeable and more importantly a great ambassador for your store . My friend and I both  made substantial purchases and had a fabulous shopping experience made all the more pleasant by this young man."
Stephen O’Keefe,4,Today a friend and I went into Meyers…,Great,Today a friend and I went into Meyers Fragrance department to look and purchase some fragrance. We met two very pleasant and helpful salespeople who went way beyond the call of duty to assist us.In a climate of retail customer service starvation it was a very enjoyable experience to encounter these wonderful ladies.Their names are Cathy and  Narges.They not only were pleasant and engaging but were incredibly helpful in their assistance and knowledge.Cathy even gave us samples without us asking for them.I was in Men’s retail for 16 years and customer service was the ultimate so when you don’t get it it is very frustration.I trust these ladies will be recognised and honoured for their contribution.The next time I am in the store I will seek them out and ask if they were honoured.RegardsStephen O’KeefeSolutions 4 Life
Nash Rady,1,Unhappy customer,Bad,I have been a customer of Myer for over 40 years I have never been so disgusted with the service I have revived by the customer service department there to help with customer issues they where most unhelpful people I have ever come across I ordered a pair of shoes online I was sent a different style and shoe size when I tried to get help from customer service they where no help I asked to speak to a supervisor they told me she’ll call me right back it’s been 4 days and she still hasn’t called me back I can honestly say I will not be shopping at Myer
Kelly Duong,1,Friday 23rd Nov,Bad,"Friday 23rd Nov 2018. @ Myer HighpointI tried to find a complaint form on google and the Myer website, but I can't find it and came across this site. After my experience today at Myer, I wanted to make a complaint to someone so bad. For years now, I've shopped at Myer with no problems - honestly, the lack of staff in the other departments besides from the perfume and cosmetic department is not worth writing about because I hardly shop anywhere besides from getting perfume or makeup.Today we went the Yves Saint Laurent counter as my mum has been eyeing a perfume for a long time now. Luckily, it was what they called ""Black Friday"" so there were some sales on. At first, we were told, it was was a further 10% including the 20% from one of the girls who worked there - we thought, OK, why not. So we wanted the 90ml bottle. When the staff who helped us asked another staff member, who had just came back (from somewhere) how can she do another 10% off? They 2nd staff said, no, it should only be only 20%. The two started conversing, the 2nd staff started to ""education"" the 1st staff. I started to feel uncomfortable because I don't believe as a customer I should hear this as I found her tone not to be so pleasant. I really wanted to say something then, but I thought it was best not to interfere. The first staff made a mistake because she herself was confused due to another poster she had read for that brand; she even told us she got confused. Totally understandable. Afterwards, she said to us, the 90ml is 20%, but the gift pack (same kind of perfume, only that it's 50ml and an extra bottle of 7.2 ml or something) is 30% off. So we decided to have a think about it: should we get the 90ml (for 20% off) or 50ml in the gift pack (for 30% off).At around 2:15 to 2:30 pm, we came back deciding to get the gift pack. This time only the 2nd staff was around. When she told us the gift pack is 20%, I said, ""I thought the gift pack will get 30% off?"" This is where it went downhill (at least for me). She asked me ""why 30?"" I was taken aback.  I mean, was that a rhetorical question? 'why 30?' it was in a tone where I did not think should be reserved for customers. In my head I'm thinking, what do you mean why 30? Did she just ask why 30 to me? Then I said, ""the other girl said the gift pack has the further 10%, not the standalone 90ml."" Then she said to me, ""I already told the girl, it is only 20%, except the OPIUM (or whatever - I didn't know)."" 20% or 30% or not I don't care anymore -  I did not like her tone one bit. I said, ""I don't like your tone"" and walked away. I told mum not to go back to Myer to buy Yves Saint Laurent, go to David Jones or something - somewhere else.I'm so sorry for the long post. I need to get this off my chest. I needed to get it off my chest as soon as I walked away from Yves Saint Laurent."
Letrecia Tippett,1,Myer was once my go to store,Bad,"Myer was once my go to store, now my last choice. The reason, no service, no service, no service.  I now shop at small boutiques. In dressing rooms, staff will ask if you need any help. Good luck at Myer, where I asked an assistant for help and was told I don't work for that brand."
carol harris,1,excellent service,Excellent,Got my parcel all purchases as ordered wrapped in tissue paper and presented as per Myer. Will continue on there site it was my first experience with Myer and won’t be my last. Thank you
Ann,1,Very impressed!,Excellent,"I have been very impressed by the five-star service and professional advice that I have received from Cathy from the Clarins counter in Myer Knox City. She has always been very nice and helpful every time I go there. In fact, due to her exceptional customer service and very knowledgeable product advice, I have switched all my skin care & make up products to Clarins. I also noticed that she is a very good team player, so often I see her helping customers in the other cosmetic counters very nicely. I would highly recommend her to any employer!"
AL,2,Horrendous customer service,Bad,"Horrendous customer serviceFor the first time i made a purchase off the Myers website, of course there wasn't any problems with them recieving payment and emailing me that they got the order but after that absolutely nothing. I don't know whether they need to order the package in from out of state or whats happening i've tried messaging Myers directly but no response. A update system for people who order online would be great. Would i reccomend buying stuff off Myers to a friend? no way save yourself some time and get it from another place, will never again use Myers."
Jolanta Sinclair,1,On rare occasions I had a good service,Bad,"On rare occasions I had a good service, however yesterday experience was shocking.I wanted to buy pashmina. It was a new idea, a few people I know, own one, I did not see any purpose having one, yesterday I decided I needed just something like that.I knew it could be purchased at Myer's. So I went to Karriyup store.I asked a shop assistant to find one. Not only she had no idea (working in this department) where one was, she had no idea, what it was.I tried to explain, still no results. She started to show me other shawls. Despite me repeating it was made of wool, she showed me different made of artificial fabric. She only showed me those which were on sale. She pointed to one specific and said it was very expensive. The price was $ 29. I don't know how she assessed my wealth or lack of it, apart from me speaking with different 'accent'. What a rude, horrible behavior. I experienced the same when I wanted to buy sunglasses.Very young girls were lecturing me about everything, including the climate in Perth, I have been living longer here than they are on this earth. They were unwilling to put any effort in assisting me.Lazy, rude, stupid young women. How did they get the job ?Online purchase was a total disaster.A very bad experience in other Myer stores too. If customers are such nuisance, don't sell anything, just have the company for people working there."
Sal K,1,The service that I have received from…,Excellent,"The service that I have received from Marianne at the Lancôme counter at Macquarie Park has always been exceptional, she knows the products very well and I always feel she has my best interest at heart."
Claire,3,Worst online shopping experience…,Bad,"Worst online shopping experience ever!!!!! Next day delivery?? Good luck if you ever receive your items!!  What a scam! Don’t fall for it shop elsewhere. Buyers beware..,,,I purchased a handbag from Myer online over 1 month ago. I paid for next day delivery...what a joke, I still haven’t got the item I paid for. It took the courier 1 week, yes a whole week to collect the bag from the Southland store. Then after an unsuccessful attempt to deliver the item a card was left with no details of where the item was. Days later I was able to track it to s local 7 eleven. Long story short..,,due to the utter incompetence of Myer to not follow up if an item has not been collected by the courier service. I am still waiting for the item to show up somewhere:-(I really am horrified at this appalling lack of customer service..Seriously what’s the point of advertising next day delivery if you can’t provide it!!!.Now after 2 unsuccessful attempts to collect my item due to the incompetence of the courier service it’s now been returned to Myer. I have no idea where as there is no tracking ...courier simply sent me an email stating it had been returned to Myer and to chase my refund with them.  Good luck with that I’m not expecting much from Myer as they’ve proved themselves to be a very poor excuse for a retailer."
Joanne Woodland,1,Purchased online from Myer September…,Bad,Purchased online from Myer September 23rd still no parcel delivery ; customer service don’t answer calls on hold for 1 hr then disconnected ; emails not responded to ;
Jessica Tatzenko,1,Waited 10 days for a chopping board to…,Bad,Waited 10 days for a chopping board to be delivered. Collected it from the post office cracked. Called the customer service team to be told I either needed to post it back wait for it to be received and then they could send the replacement. I said I’ve already waited the 10 days can you send me a new one now so I don’t need to wait another 2 weeks. No that’s not our policy.Then suggested going into store. I asked them to call the store and get back to me. They said they don’t need to do this. I had to call. Called the store 3 times no answer. Was advised they had 4 in stock. Took a nervous punt and went into the store when I got there they said they had none and could only offer me a refund. Horrible service and I essentially waited 2 weeks to not have the product but a huge amount of frustration.
jana,1,"LATE delivery, NOT 4-7 days",Bad,"Long time Myer customer. Always shop in store. Decided, for convenience to go with an online order this time. Ordered two products from Myer on 9/10/18. Received an email on Friday 12/10/18 to say your order is on its way. It certainly was NOT on its way. I now receive an email (16/10/18) saying your order will be delivered on Monday 22/10/18. So really, a very misleading statement on their website - 4-7 business days free delivery- it is now actually 9 days,10 if you count the order date. Be honest on your website. If you can't deliver within the timeframe allocated notify the customer as to why it is taking longer than stated on the website. False and misleading claims. Very disappointing."
Amanda,1,Appalling Service and Delivery,Bad,Ordered 2 x dinner sets on a Monday. It took until the following Monday to arrive. Dispatch was from a store 30 minutes away. Both dinner sets arrived broken and the box was not marked fragile. One box did not have the packing installed properly as it had been opened previously. As well as the broken items 2 x bowls without packing between them were jammed together and could not be prised apart.  I actually looked elsewhere on line and found the dinner set cheaper with a dispatch/delivery of 2 x days. I can only class this as appalling service and delivery! Don't think I would bother ordering from Myer again after this experience.
Kiki,1,Bad click and collect system,Bad,"Place the order online on Friday night, chose ""click & collect"", said the product was in stock, I could pick it up by 10am on Sat. Waited another email ""ready to collect"", not coming. Rang up to track the order, was told I could receive the email anytime soon. Went to the store, they had the product in stock, but didn't want to give it to me. I had to wait until the one is coming somewhere from the other store. I asked ""why don't you give it to me one you've got?"", the myer guy said ""it doesn't work that way."" What a great system! Never buy anything from Myer."
Sarah Gooder,1,At Myer Morley I had to deal with a rude manager,Bad,At Myer Morley I had to deal with a manager named Steve and he was so rude to his staff right in front of me! Poor girls were nothing but helpful and he seemed to have no idea. I can’t believe how he spoke in front of me! It has turned me off returning.
Frank Petelin,1,Pathetic after sales service,Bad,"Pathetic customer service experience using Myer online and instore, purchased a handbag online, when delivered the strap was missing, I called  Myer who advised me to either return the item in the post or return to a Myer store at my incovenience. Incidentally I was also not provided a return con note slip so I could post the item back! I visited the Myer Highpoint store (vic) on the 28/09/18 on a Victorian public Holiday at my inconvenience where I have way better things I could be doing on my ONE day off! I spoke to a lady at the Handbag register within the store regarding my handbag purchased online that was supplied to me without a strap rendering the item completely useless. The lady was completely stand offish and blunt stating that I cannot return the item in store and need to send it in via the post, when I asked if it can simply be exchanged for one ""WITH"" a strap she bluntly told me that they do not even stock that handbag in the store! So I am standing there In a Myer store with a Myer supplied product that I have purchased with no assistance what so ever and a blunt employee telling me that I now have to post this item back and waste more of my own time keeping in mind I then had to contact Myer AGAIN to get a return con note emailed to me so I can actually post this item back!!!! Happy to take my hard earned money to sell me the item and then make it damn near impossible for me to have this issue rectified through no fault of my own. Pathetic Customer Service! I will NOT recommend using Myer to anybody I know nor will I use Myer again myself, I prefer to pay more for an item from any other store and receive quality customer service and after sales assistance, for that matter even buying on line direct from China at a quarter of the sale price and delivered to my door WITH a strap would be better than experiencing this pathetic type of after sales lack of care or regard for a customer!"
Leigh,1,Customer service number never answered and in-store transfers don't get delivered,Bad,Customer service number never gets answered.  Ordered an online item six days ago - still no delivery for click and collect.  Ordered item from Next in the UK on the same day and it arrived in 5 days.  Tracking system down and public holiday blamed for the delay.  A transfer from another store.. really ??  Absolutely pathetic Myer.
CG,2,Myer online poor service,Bad,"Myer online. Bad service. As per Auspost, my Myer parcel was not clearly mentioned receiver address or sender details. Because of that, my parcel was on hold in the transit post office without any notification. After 10 days of purchase still, I didn't receive my order.When I am trying to contact Myer, there are no email address to contact them either. helpless after purchase from Myer online.Will never purchase from Myer online again."
Jane Wilson,1,TAKING SHAPE CLOTHES - MYER HOBART 22/9/2018,Bad,"Myer Hobart 22/09/2018 - attended a Taking Shape fashion parade by invitation & won 1 of 2 “lucky door” prizes - $49.95 voucher for TS accessories - very nice BUT there were strings attached which were ... had to be used that day 22/9 only, also the current retail prices 40% discount (Australia wide/online) did not apply!! The choice of TS accessories was poor ie, hardly any. I relinquished the voucher for a full price to me bag $49.95 which was for sale to everyone else at $29.95 - how misleading & unprofessional to offer such conditions to a prize (was told after receiving the voucher) so other attendees were unaware it wasn’t what it seemed, better to have not bothered Taking Shape - UNETHICAL & DISAPPOINTING - spoilt my experience + it amounted to $29.95 not $49.95 which was incorrect retail value on the day - is this permissible under ACCC law?? Really how pathetically stingy can TS be to a prize recipient let alone a long time customer. THE POSITIVE OUTCOME IS THAT MY PURCHASES ARE BEING RETURNED AND I WILL NEVER EVER BE A TAKING SHAPE CUSTOMER AGAIN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES."
Cheryl Macfarlane,1,NO SERVICE COULDN'T CARE LESS ATTITUDE,Bad,Disgusting service or should I say no service.  Staff are not familiar with deals etc.  The worst  cosmetic staff ever.   I've shopped in several stores throughout Australia and have to say Stockland Townsville the very worst.
Helyn,1,Yesterday I had a wonderful shopping…,Excellent,Yesterday I had a wonderful shopping experience at your Pacific Fair store with assistance from the lovely Karen Stevenson in the shoe department. Being someone who is not fond of shopping and partly disabled Karen’s kindness and understanding was so amazing that I could not pass up the opportunity to tell as many people as possible.  I left the store feeling on top of the world. Karen if you ever get to read this I just want to let you know that I appreciate everything you did for me and I now have a better opinion of shopping.
P Doyle,1,Not happy,Bad,Not happy. Perth store staff member in the Polo area was careless with the sale resulting in a $51 overcharge. Went to Myer Morley to get a refund. The store manager showed no interest in raising the mistake with the Perth store so that others that may have been overcharged could be identified; or the staff member given guidance. It took us three trips to Myer to get our money back and received a curt 'sorry.'  Take home message; be careful to check your receipt for overcharge and don't get hopes up that Myer will leave you feeling they are care.  Disappointing.
Leanne Hawkins,1,I visited your Myer Bendigo store…well done Val!,Excellent,"I visited your Myer Bendigo store today, and couldn't have been more happy with the service! I was looking for some shoes for a wedding and was served by Val,who I believe has been in this department for a long time, as she certainly knows her products! I always have problems buying shoes as I have large, wide feet! Although she was the only service assistant in this department and was serving about four customers at the time, she kept her cool and remained very professional throughout the whole time! She even brought out more shoes for me to try on! Need I say I bought some shoes from her today and hope she gets acknowledged for her exceptional service today under difficult circumstances! Thankyou and I'll definitely be back to purchase from Val well done!"

Tina,1,DONT SHOP HERE...,Bad,"Worse online shopping site. Don’t advertise An everyday item on sale if you can’t provide back orders. Couldn’t use my rewards card ,  trying to spend enough for free delivery, system wouldn’t let me so could only buy one of the items and got charged delivery.After calling to errectify problem twice for 45mins each time, probs still not rectified....Hung up on, didn’t call me back, complained second day, team manager didn’t call me back ...VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.Staff are arrogant and treat you with a ...that’s just the way it is... attitude...Save yourself the pain and shop elsewhere.As for your catch fraze song...MYER IS NOT MY STORE...Taking my dollars to DJ’s"

Gary Meyer,1,Their customer support is a joke,Bad,"Their customer support is a joke, if they want to survive in the online business they better pick up their game, bloody pathetic.Called to trackl an order, put inb the order nr and line gets cut.Call customer support, sit on the phone for over half an hour no one picks up.Want to leave messages on their site, forget about it.PATHETIC BUY ELSEWHERE ONLINE"
Paula,2,Poor customer service again and again,Bad,I purchased an item online with Myer. Received the wrong item . I now have to go to a post and line up to return this item as it is too big for a post box. Other companies will pick up the incorrect item . Also will not send out the correct item until they receive this item back.  Rude and smug customer service. I will be returning my Myer one card with the parcel. Good luck new CEO!!! It's not House of Fraser.

He said sorry no will be in that section for another 1/2 hour. Discussed with the service.
pandadownunda panda,1,Worst Security Guard ever! Being Black...,Bad,"Monday Morning, 30.07.2018 Myer store Karrinyup, Perth WAKids dropped off, I might as well have a stroll trough Myer (as every second week latest) I go to the dessous appartement and as I am looking at the bras I realize a security guard is watching me and even 20min later after trying on several bras, as I exit the changing rooms I spot almost right away the security guard still in the dessous section watching me. I feel a bit creepy and weird being followed so I pay the dessous immediately although I am not finished with my Myer shopping spree, hoping the security guy will back offAnd let me enjoy my wonderful Monday morning. But as I wander around the Seed section, I notice the security guard is still following me?Another 15 min later, after trying on a few dresses at the Review department I come out the changing rooms and the same security guy is still there!? I start wondering and looking around to see if I am the only customer in the whole entire 3 story store?! And again I feel pressured to pay immediately my clothing and since I am annoyed by the penetrant behavior of the security guard I decide to leave Myer and continue my shopping spree at David Jones. I walk towards the exit and of course the security beeper goes off, as always! (Why dear Myer can't you get that right?! And yes one of your employees has explained it to me in the past, which sounds like very lame excuse to me and also is absolutely NOT customer friendly!) So because I'm aware that the security alarm at the entrance will go off (as always) I pretty much walk towards the Chanel Cosmetic Sales Woman showing my shopping bags and asking her to pls check my clothing to make sure there are no security tags attached. (wouldn't be the first time a sales person forgot to dettach it🙁) And while your cosmetic employee is already checking through my bags, guess who storms up to us and snatches the shopping bags out of the Sales Woman hands!?! Of course Mr Creepy Security Guard! The sales woman is just as shocked and overwhelmed as I am because the Security guard interrupts us with an aggressive approach and just grabs the bags Away saying: I HAVE TO CHECK THE BAGS! THe Sales Woman is so intimated by this situation she just flees the scene and almost hides behind her lipstick stand?! I am Standing there shocked and shaking my head, as I ask that security guard why he grabbed my bags away from the Myer Employee he yells at me:THIS IS MY JOB!   As he is looking through my shopping bags I can't help myself to ask him if it also his job to follow me for 20 min while I am trying on dessous and then another 20min although I did already pay for my purchases? At this point the security guard is denying everything and with a very aggressive attitude still yelling at me :THIS IS MY JOB! while turning away from me with MY BAGS! So because I am gettin scared and I just want to leave this store I ask him pls to finish his Job and hand me quickly my bags! The security guard now is almost holding my bags behind his back and refusing to hand them back!? Like he is trying to force me to stand there at the entrance of Myer and being humiliated by this absolutely ridiculous scene.As I am watching him holding back MY BAGS I realise this person can not have any kind of qualified trainee, so I ask the security guard to immediately hand me my bags so I can go directly to the store Manager to complain. He is not bothered at all, even when I ask him if he really thinks his intention to scare away long time customers and treat me like Sh$#* conform with Myer and his Employer?Even then he doesn't care and goes on like a Robocop : 'THIS IS MY JOB!' After complaining to the manager, I really don't have the feeling anyone cares for my f&$#%' up shopping experience at Myer. I don't understand why Myer would hire such unprofessional, unqualified and rude security guards? I really question the entire Security company? Is this a new company because in all my 8 years shopping at MyerI have never seen /noticed these guards before nor have I experienced anything negative in your Karrinyup Store? Dear Myer is this your true intention, to chase out regular good paying customers, by hiring unqualified Security guards which penetrant us while we just want to spend our money in your store?! If yes then I guess I f#:'&*in WAS your regular good paying customers. Side Note:I was styled and wearing designer clothes, But perhaps the fact that I AM HALF BLACK Woman Could be probably the reason your security guard TERRORIZED me and NOT another customer! I don't expect anything from you because we are all aware you are a big, big Retailer and you don't depend on ON ONE BLACK WOMANVice versa do not expect me to have any kind words about Myer in anyway to anyone. RegardsBLACK CUSTOMERPS Why do I have to rate with one Star 🌟? This sad experience is not worth anything?"
Allan Pilgrim,1,Appalled by the way I was treated…,Bad,"Appalled by the way I was treated today! I tried to buy a coffee machine online to pick up in store.  I have since cancelled the order and I will buy it from DJs, $2250, they don't care. Rude customer service staff, rude complaint staff, I'll be cancelling my card tomorrow."
Keith Langton,1,Painfull shopping,Bad,"Looking for men's clothes in Geelong store - many staff around -obviously not from sales - standing in front of mirrors chatting oblivious to customer. That was bad enough but when a team member came behind my wife and startled her. I did not realise the extent of his rudeness until we were home, His comment was ""I only did it once."" I think this is bullying and intimidation. However the person on the checkout was very polite and most helpful. If you want to be suprised when shopping go to Men""s wear Myer Geelong."

Del,1,Bangkok markets,Bad,"I enjoy going to Myer Sydney every weekend. I often do some shopping and I always look forward to having a meal on level 5. Of late I have noticed the staff at the cafe to be really rude, no customer service skills at all and I feel it’s too much of a bother for them to serve the customer. A few times they would just slam the plates on the table as if they were feeding a dog. Then I notice they speak in a different language(Thai I think) in front of customers and would talk loudly. Please remind them this is not Bangkok markets. Really disappointed. I think it’s time to look for another place to eat after shopping. Please also teach them to smile a little bit, I Wish Myer Sydney would fix this. Thank you"
Anna,1,Very bad service,Bad,Very bad service
Kathryn,2,Extremely disappointing...,Bad,"Extremely disappointing.... Myer advertised a gift with purchase during a promotional period however staff at Myer in the Canberra Centre advised that the gifts were reserved for their ‘special’ customers (interested to know who/what deems you to be a ‘special’ customer?). When questioned about the fairness of this practice, they advised that it is common across Myer departments.Reported this as a complaint to Myer Customer service who recorded the feedback. Not sure what action is or will be taken from the feedback. This practice made the gift with purchase unavailable to customers who actually qualified for the gift."
Brad Colligan,1,WORST STAFF I HAVE EVER SEEN,Bad,"Attended Myer Bankstown on Friday and bought a pair of $150 boots. When i got home (after driving twenty minutes) I opened the package and found only one shoe in the box. Never happened before but people make mistakes, so I drove back to Bankstown Myer. On arrival I firstly waited 15 minutes wilst the lady attendant had a chat to one of her co-workers. Eventually she came over and firstly accused me of stealing a shoe ( I have two feet by the way). She told me that I had bought the last pair and I must have it!!!!! So I went over to the display and found another shoe exactly the same and same size. I asked if this could possibly be the other shoe? So she rudely took the (second hand) shoe and put it in the box and without even an apology. So I then complained to Myer head office and guess what NO ANSWER to my emails or phone calls. Sorry Myer never ever again will I shop at Myer. Your customer service and staff are the worst in any industry I have ever seen......"
Billy Adams,1,Incompetent staff,Bad,"A particular staff member at the Melbourne city Myer today was stupid, incompetent and outrageoslly dumb. She refused our family in using our Myer one points for our purchase today. We have been loyal to this company for many years until today. WE FEEL OFFENDED AND ASHAMED FROM MYERS ACTIONS TODAY."
Lore Mart,1,I am really annoyed with Myers gift…,Poor,"I am really annoyed with Myers gift voucher policy. Once they receive the money from the person buying the voucher, they are quick to impose rules on how and when the receiver can spend the money. One month to user a voucher is just ridículos. From the time your loved one buys the voucher to when you have time to go to the store, one month is long gone. Shame on you Myers for stealing money from your customers."
J shipway,1,Well for along time,Poor,"Well for along time, I have never fancied Myer, over priced so called fashion, see your self walk around the corner. To dark hate prints flowers etc. fashion hasn’t appealed to me for a long time get someone else rather than the buyers you have that would make a difference."
Lee Vo,1,Things Change at Werribee Myer.,Great,"My parents living in the west.. Sometime I do something shopping with them at MYER in Werribee. For the last 8 months , i found the customer service there very poor & the staffs not very friendly & helpful . Today I went back with my mum & I found the whole department completely changed.. The staff are so Friendly & everyone said hello to you & asking if you need any help . Wow I’m very surprise & feel welcome. Weldone  MYER in Werribee, i think the GM are getting the message now if they want to compete with David Jones Store in the Future. Kind Regards, L Vo."
Chrisentiae Saint-Piaf,19,Myer is a horrible experience.,Bad,"Myer is a horrible experience.Some Myer staff ignore customers, and will chat merrily away about whatever, and leave customers waiting for minutes at a time. At other times they are invasive with comments and unprofessional.Other Myer staff are good.Myer have problems that go well beyond their insanely overpriced goods."
Dhillon07,1,"I went myer Werribee,Victoria so many …",Bad,"I went myer Werribee,Victoria so many  times to buy some beauty products but no one assist me..one lady was doing make up to someone in the estee lauder section ....i stayed there for 5 min.to have someone to assist me but she totally ignores me.Then i said to her i need something but she talked very rudely and said am very busy plz find someone else.I could not find anybody so after waiting a while...i just walk away from there.I felt very dissapointed and dont want to go there again.I dont understand why they have so many beauty sections if they cant assist the customers.Very bad."
l.p,1,Went to Myer Perth on Saturday,Bad,"Went to Myer Perth on Saturday, completely understaffed. No one manning the fitting rooms, a bucket of clothes spilling onto the floor as their was no rail for unwanted garments. Went into a fitting room which had been recently renovated and was shocked to find chewing gum lining the walls, dust, dirt, swing tags and security devices on the floor. There was no where for me to even hang the clothes in the fitting room as it looked like the rail in there had fallen off. So I had to put the items on the dirty ground before trying them on! While trying a dress on a security alarm started sounding on the dress. I ventured out looking for someone to help me, you would think if an alarm was sounding someone would attend? No. Didn’t even bother to try the other items. I have photos of the state of the fitting rooms, however on the Myer website there seems to be no option to leave customer feedback. Won’t be shopping in Myer again, and I don’t think it will be long until they are the next retailer to go under."
Robyn,1,MYERS 3 HOUR CLICK AND COLLECT ONLINE…,Bad,"MYERS 3 HOUR CLICK AND COLLECT ONLINE SHOPPING IS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE!!!!!Placed my 3rd online and LAST EVER order with Myer on Monday... opted for 3 hour click and collect!!!! Its Thursday now, and I've been phoning since Monday afternoon, being left on hold for extended periods, promised that ALL my products would be ready...they are still not. Worse part my sons Bray has been and gone, THANK GOD I managed to scrape enough time in between work..kids and their sport to go to KMART to get him some presents.NEVER AGAIN MYER...3RD TIME BURNED BY YOUR DISGUSUSTING FRAUDLETUNT RUDE SERVICE. Worst part as I write this... I've been on hold again for 15 minutes and I phoned right on 9am....Absolute DISGRACE MYER!!!!"
Anastassia,1,Don't ever shop online,Bad,"After being a loyal customer for many years, I have made a terrible error of making an online purchase. I bought a dress, which was a few hundred dollars, and it arrived without any protective wrapping or even an authentic/original tag. I noticed straight away that it had a blue mark at the front of the dress - I believe it was from the tag which was written in blue pen! Besides this, on close inspection, it turned out the dress had two holes and the pockets had stitching that was undone. It was obvious that this dress has been worn before and returned to the store, to be sent to me under the pretence of being a new dress. I emailed Myer about this embarassing shopping experience and all they could say is oh we should have proceses in place to check quality, it must not have happened this time. That's not good enough. No customer should ever have to experience this! How can you even have such a faulty dress in stock, not to mention sell it for this price and send faulty without even checking it! I will not be doing any online shopping with Myer again."
Susan Phillips,3,Bought shoes this afternoon at Myer …,Excellent,Bought shoes this afternoon at Myer  Miranda  Fair. Staff were so polite  even though very very busy  with  sales on. Wished myself and others a Happy Mothers Day  for tomorrow.  Even  helped me  by using their phone to log on email address for competition at  the  moment. Also  the  $10 off for Myer One members. Praise deserved. 😊
Jansu Akgun,1,Misleading customers,Bad,Purchased a watch online last night which was confirmed. Then went back into site to view the watch which read out of stock. The next day I received a email claiming my order was cancelled. I called to be told I might of cancelled the order or the credit card didn’t pay them. Fun that I got the blame and that I should take it up with the bank and it’s not from there end. Oh by the way it my debit card with funds to buy Min 10 watches. I ask if the watch was available and was told it seems like there was one in stock but no guarantee. In other words they don’t have it but found a easy way out by faulting the bank. First and last time I will be buying from Myers online. Misleading customers in having the stock available.
Penny Watson,1,Failure of service.,Bad,"I order about $160 worth of stuff online cos I had been given a $50 giftcard for Christmas. Part of the order was 6 towels, 3 red and 3 black. About a week later my order arrives without the black.I call myer and they try to blame Australia post (I work there) and say they have to contact AusPost before they can do anything. I had called AusPost before calling myer and they said that while they got the shipping information about the towels, they never received the towels themselves. I end up having to call them back a couple of weeks later cos they never got back to me and they say they have to call AusPost to get them to report the towels as ""lost in transit"" which I thought was strange because if AusPost never received the towels, why would they admit a fault that wasn't there's?Anyway, I called myer again a few weeks later because again, they never got back to me. I finally just ask for a refund but when I hang up, I get these emails saying ""your return has been processed, send back the towels"" or something like that. I ignore it cos I figured it might be one of those auto emails that gets sent out because of the way they need to do this return. So I wait a little while, I get busy, them I realise I never got my money back. I call again (and by this time I really want to tell them to change their hold music) and Finally get a refund processed by a nice lady. After that phonecall I get an email saying my return egift card is available... the nice lady never mentioned a gift card? I don't want credit, I don't shop at myer! I had to call up the next day and they told me that because I partially paid with a $50 gift card, that they had to give me my $45 back as a giftcard! I ask if there's anything they can do because I don't want a gift card and they said no. Now I'm very upset and annoyed that this took 3 months to sort out! I just want my money back. This is a failure of service and I am very disappointed."
Alice Smith,1,Since when is so hard to ask what size?,Bad,"During my experience at Myers I had asked if they had any leotards or bodysuits suitable for an adult women, I was immediately take to the kids section even after specifying womens. Yes I don't exactly look 20 and that was amusing however what really got me in the mood was how I was addressed by your employee Sandra at Fountain Gate Myers, I was addressed as a bigger girl. I may not be on the very slim or slimmer side but I'd hardly say I classify as a bigger girl or just a big girl in general and the remark has truly put me off. Never before have I ever been addressed as a bigger girl no matter where I went, surly asking what size would have been a better choice then that"
Mischa,2,DO NOT BUY FROM MYER ONLINE,Bad,"DO NOT BUY FROM MYER ONLINE! Absolute WORST procedures in place for exchanges. Online phone service has no idea what is able to be exchanged in store PLUS when I ordered online it took 2 WEEKS TO GET FROM SYDNEY TO MELBOURNE!I can order things from America and the UK and get them delivered quicker! Their exchange policy is not doable under afterpay but apparently the lady on the phone says the store should do it but I just can't be bothered driving around for an hour paying for parking to try and go back and find out if this is true. NOT WORTH THE 2 WEEKS WAITING, 2 HOUR TRIP TO MYER AND $15 IN PARKING PLUS HAVING TO PAY POSTAGE FOR RETURN OF THE WRONG PRODUCTS SHIPPED! UNBELIEVABLE IN 15 YEARS BUYING ONLINE I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED SUCH A DISORGANISED RIDICULOUS ONLINE STORE!STAY AWAY SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE"
Cathy,1,Great service in lingerie at Myer…but not so at the Lancôme counter.,Bad,Great service in lingerie at Myer Pacific Fair.Wanting to buy a Lancôme mascara....two women totally ignored me. You lost a purchase and I felt invisible.
Val Duncan,1,Castle Towers Myer,Excellent,"Castle Towers Myer. Apr 2The young man John in the menswear  shirt department could not have been more helpful, giving me shirts to try on to determine the best size & recommending the brands which were most suitable.  Because of his assistance I purchased 3 shirts instead of walking out confused with the different choices."
Barbara,1,I recently visited Myer Rundle Mall to…,Excellent,I recently visited Myer Rundle Mall to purchase a mascara i was served by an exceptionaliy friendly and helpful lady by the name of Jenny at the Shisiedo counter. She not only sold me the mascara but reccomended many other products to suit my skin. What an assset to have MYER !!!!!!!Well done and keep up the good work Jenny .
josephine josephine,1,Really bad online customers service,Bad,"Really bad online customers service, gift card team. Stay away, from the online shopping and buying a gift card.Me and my sister placed an order online on Wednesday, and got cancellation email on Thursday. And get a refund gift card, but when i try to use it its suspended.  I call 4 times kn thursday, and they keep sending me toOther differences number, finally they ask me to sent an email to online.sales@@@myer.com. I wait for 3 days to get and reply but is nothing. I try to call again on Saturday. I call 3 different number and again they keep sending me. They said we cant fix it here, what i can do transfer u to Blablabla. After all this experience i dont want any gift card, i just want my money back!!! Really horrible experience."
Ivor Cordeiro,1,To whom it may consern,Excellent,"To whom it may consern. I Ivor Cordeiro from 11 Orloff Street, Keysborough, 3173 would like to take this opportunity to thank Sonia from mens wear in Southland Shopping centre, Melbourne, for going out of her way of trying to explain and show me mens garments that I was looking for. She is exceptionally good in her work and I wish there were a few more employes like her that would have those qualities like Sonia to help customers when they truly need help. She shows emphaty, kindness and understanding, and above all patience. May she be successful in all her endeavours. Thank You Sonia."
Maya Pentony,1,I was at Myer Karrinyup today.,Bad,"I was at Myer Karrinyup today.I went to the electrical department to see if they had the UE wonderboom they had, except it was advertised as $129 .I had intended going to JB hI FI OR  the good guys as their price was $99Having always been a supporter of myer I asked if they could price match to save me a tripNo... the best they could do was $105sadly in these hard times I could not believe that they would not come down to $99so off I went and gave my business to JB Hi fivery poor in my opinion"
Mariyana Ogilvie,1,The Revlon sales lady at Myer Morley…,Excellent,"The Revlon sales lady at Myer Morley has been there as long as I can remember, I now know why. I don't go anywhere else to buy my makeup,she is always so helpful ,only problem is I end up up buying so much more than I originally intended.."
Liz Kane,2,Do Myer value their staff?,Poor,"I shopped at Myer about a month ago and left a review about the wonderful service I received from an employee at Myer Carousel Cannington W.A. I left my phone number and email address and said I was happy to be contacted. I went back to the store today and was really disappointed to find out that the staff member hadn't been told about my review. I spoke to a floor supervisor and she said the reviews go to Melbourne, but Myer Cannington should have been made aware of my comment and the staff member should have been praised for what I considered was exceptional service. The same staff member served me today and I got the same exceptional service. It's disappointing to know that Myer has someone working so hard and despite leaving her name and all the details of my experience, she got no recognition whatsoever. If Myer doesn't value it's employees enough to pass on praise from a customer, then no it's no wonder their share price is so low. If I was the employee, I'd be looking for a job at a place where customer praise was passed on and my hard work was recognized. I was very disappointed that after going to the effort of writing a review, I completely wasted my time and an excellent employee didn't receive any recognition for her work. I wonder why she keeps working so hard? The floor supervisor told me that it's better to speak directly to someone at the store than to bother with writing a review, which obviously gets filed in the bin."
Jenny. Campbell,1,MYER Bondi Junction.,Poor,MYER Bondi Junction.. it is always difficult to find any staff to serve you. They seem to function on minimal staffing and this has been an ongoing problem for sometime. Also occurs in the City store particular bedding and kitchenware dept. Have found staff unhelpful dealing with warranties and poor quality items. Twice I have been informed I have to contact the manufacturer to deal with expensive poor quality items. It is not a wonder MYER is loosing customers.
Joy,1,Myer is awesome but some people who…,Average,Myer is awesome but some people who work there are not. Liverpool kidswear has a supervisor who is just telling staff to do this and that and all this while they are with customers talking. Poor staffs apologise to us and acknowledge customers and at the back supervisor would keep talking telling them to do stuff. Customers are important and work will be done and please treat people whom you work with right.
Christine cramsie,2,A great experience,Excellent,"On Monday 19 March, I took my 70 year old cousin to Myer Blacktown for a bra fitting.  She has a severe intellectual disability, other physical disabilities and is wheelchair-bound so the fitting was challenging for all concerned.However, the staff at Blacktown coped wonderfully and treated my cousin with great kindness, patience and skill and the fitting, which took a very long time, resulted in a perfect bra for her.  I was most grateful for and impressed by the care shown by all and can thoroughly recommend this department and store."
Alice,1,Garden City Ladies rude!,Bad,"Bad attitude from the staff at Garden City WA in the bra area.Couldn't find anyone to help me, the staff were all chatting out the back of the fitting rooms!!The lady who served me was apologetic to a point before blaming management for the lack of staff, it being busy (I was one of four customers in the area) . Clearly it wasnt too busy for them to be talking about lunch or painting instead of helping customers and helping Myer make money. No passion, no interest- time to retire ladies!!"
N.Perera,1,"Myer Castle Towers,",Great,"Myer Castle Towers,Visited on the 2nd of March, to exchange an item, I think she was Beth, even though the receipt says Beverly was so very helpful. Very good service. Myer at Castle Towers, I find that the service is good."
Sandy,1,Very disappointed!,Bad,"Service at the Estee Lauder counter in Maroochydore store was appalling. After waiting for 20 minutes to speak with the consultant, she was annoyed that I was unhappy with the colour match sample I had been given previously, and refused to retest my skin colour with the colour match machine.  Just gave me another colour that is about 6 shades too dark and was very rude about it! will buy my Estee Lauder elsewhere!"
Patricia Spierings,1,Disgusted,Bad,"Absolutely disgusting customer service at Myer Highpoint.There's a bunch of salty old women working there who clearly think they are a few notches above the rest of us.Zero people skills, rude intolerant & condescending.I will never shop there again.The younger staff are better but having those old hags working there, is giving Myer a very bad name.I'm not alone in my opinion either!Time for a big stock take Myer. Start with the 3rd floor women 🤔"
Jane B,3,Received my goods in excellent time and…,Great,Received my goods in excellent time and everything was packaged perfectly. Would definitely shop at Myer.com.au again.
David Richardson,1,Myer Perth Staff in menswear friendly…,Excellent,"Myer Perth Staff in menswear friendly ,efficient and most helpful"
Michael Stirling,3,Bad online experience...,Bad,"Shopping with Myer online is not a pleasant experience. First I was trying to purchase a lamp, the lamp clearly was displayed as ""take a further 50 percent off"",  yet when I got to the checkout, it was 40 percent off. This is false advertising. Second visit I was trying to buy a travel coffee mug on a free shipping weekend. I added the $10 item to my bag and proceeded to the checkout. The checkout said my purchase would attract a $65 postage fee as it is a bulky product. I emailed Myer through Facebook and Myer assured me the problem would be fixed, yet when I return the item still has a $65 shipping fee... What a joke, surely a company the size of Myer can fix their website. Going to take my business where it is wanted."
Mally Richardson,1,Unfriendly staff put you off shopping,Poor,"The staff are arrogant @Warringah Mall Myer. I don't know where they get their attitudes from but management need to think about retraining their staff - especially on customer service. You are in retail, get over yourselves. Please do not stand around gossiping, obstructing the pathway and turning your nose away at people who would like to shop there. And can you please have someone be at the counter so we can actually buy your products. Management, your staff need to realise that it's the people i.e. customers that give them the job in the first place."
Roxi,1,Sidney Myer would be sooo very …,Bad,"Sidney Myer would be sooo very disappointed in his vision and creation of a once great business. He kept up with the times and change direction as needed by listening to what society wanted and needed.Myer is so stuck in the 80s 90s visually, mentally and financial blockage.Most stores fixtures are old and out dated.  Visual merchandising in many departments are uninspiring, boring just depressing. You just dont want to buy you actually want to get out of the store.Doesnt make you want to buy a 300 dollar or more something been shoved on a very cramped and out of date shelf.Its like just stock it shelve it and hope for the best. No passion,no vision,no thought,no imagination.Sidney Myers creation and spirit of the Myer name and vision has been totally destroyed.Dont you realise customers today are looking for the shopping experience of inspiration, creativity, innovation, ambience, a days shopping destination, interactive customer service, awe inspiring store maybe fantasy like concept.Department Stores in Australia really need a totally new concept. A whole new concept for the times.I think Myer knows this but has another agenda for the failing business."
Tamara Symss,1,How is this store still in business?,Bad,How disgusting. Online shopping is usually fun for me but good old Myer have completely stuffed it for me. How is this store still in business???
Rebecca,1,Myer need to change and put customer service at its core,Poor,"I went to Myer (Bondi Junction) today (Saturday) to get some Clinique makeup. I go to the Clinique section and am unable to find the specific Clinique person to assist me. I wait there a number of minutes and still no one. I go to another makeup counter to ask for assistance from someone else who says that she didn't know where the Clinique representative was - perhaps on a break and asked for me to wait. I asked if there was somebody else who I could speak with or a manager as I couldn't understand why I need to wait when there are a number of employees who work for Myer, who are not busy, yet won't serve me because they are affiliated with a certain brand. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! Myer really need to re-think their strategy of customer service as it has really turned me off and will consider going elsewhere. Eventually I convinced someone to help and both of us had to rummage through the Clinique cupboards to find the three products I was looking for. I can't believe I have to beg and plead to get served at this place. The lady was nice enough but no longer a Myer fan."
Maria Rogers,1,Disgusting customer service at Mayer-never before-is that why they are going bad???,Bad,"Hi - I see the news where Myer are closing stores-and worried about breaking even-so they want the sympathy vote from their shoppers- I love shopping at Myer and DJ's-not at Myer any more -I have tried to be faithful to them but honestly Adelaide City is worse than Harris Scarf!!! They have no stock of OPI nail polish - half the display is empty. Since Christmas they have had 25% off Natio- a great saving -but for the past 3 weeks they have had no stock IN ESP of their Rose range. Having spoke with Natio this should have been replenished. However on speaking with a very very ill informed sales person yesterday at TTP-she informed me that Christmas was very busy, stock haven't been replenished(um now end of Jan love) - and that the buyers 'were not buying too much'-'everybody has bills to pay-going back to school'.  ....um I would call for the sacking of this staff member!!! She did NOTHING to attempt to get the goods in; trying to blame the consumer-no wonder Mayer is going down the gurgler-with staff like her- I was horrified!!!  I want an immediate answer to this Myer and will be sending a duplicate copy to Natio-they would be horrified!!!!"
Toni,1,Orders not filled,Bad,For the second time I have ordered garments online and have waited days to be informed that they were not available - hence this review. Why are garments advertised when they are not available? Why can't the garments be ordered? No feedback has been provided - no customer service. There is no email address to communicate with online shopping. I am both very disappointed and angry. I expected better. This is the first time I have ever written to voice my opinion.Toni
Cj Li,1,Worst Online experience,Bad,"Worst Online experience waited a week to see my order cancelled, what a waste of time :( my dear Christmas present aww i even spent a lot of time doing their customer feedback........can i at least have the jacket post later with discounted price please"

Jan Wood,1,Lousy systems and customer servicer,Bad,"Ordered and paid for a a kettle online on 27 December.  The order was taken so silly me assumed that was an available kettle in stock.  Waited and waited and waited for the email to tell me that it was on its way to me.  No, nothing happened.  Today rang the 1800 number and waited waited for 35 mins - no friendly customer service person actually answered......surprise, surprise..  Then rang another number 13 69 37 and got through.  Was told that the kettle I ordered was not available but back order requests had been made 3 times but still no kettle available.I asked when I was going to be told of this and the answer was, you guessed it, SORRY.  We should have let you know.  I said what are you going to do about your lousy system and the supervisor's answer was, I have noted your feedback and will cancel your order.Myer is totalled screwed with its crappy systems and no one willing to fix the multitude of problems they seem to have.Bye Bye Myer, last time I shop with you."
Anthony,1,"""SORRY YOUR ORDER'S BEEN CANCELLED"" …",Bad,"""SORRY YOUR ORDER'S BEEN CANCELLED"" This is the message i've received a week after I ordered through their website during this busy christmas time. Buyers beware MYER cancelling orders without giving any reasons for the cancellation."
Darryl Bason,1,I placed an online order which would …,Bad,I placed an online order which would not process over the weekend. Monday i went to try and re send the order only to find all the discounts had finished. I spoke to someone for 5o minutes during which time they said they would work out the discounts and finalise the order. Only to be told at the end there is nothing they could do. this made the whole online experience time consuming and frustrating. I would never use this method of ordering again. The manager online could not even take my call after being on the phone for so long. Terrible service.
Gabriele,3,Ordered an item from Myer Online,Bad,"Ordered an item from Myer Inline, order was filled, money taken. 8 days later I recieved an email stating that the order was cancelled. It's 2017, online shopping should have live stock levels. It's not hard"
Nathan Parsons,1,I ordered an iPad from MYER online 3 …,Bad,"I ordered an iPad from MYER online 3 months ago. The iPad never arrived. Myer is claiming its the post office at fault and won't repay me till it's been investigated. 3 weeks ago MYER sent me an email saying they had recovered the iPad and were sending my refund. I'm still waiting for my money. They rarely respond to my always polite emails, when they do its just some standard bull to placate me. Its Xmas time and I am down $500. This has been my worst online experience ever. I strongly urge anyone reading this to avoid MYER"
Glynis,1,Went for a 4hour drive to Brisbane to …,Bad,"Went for a 4hour drive to Brisbane to visit Santaland as I have for the last 12 years only to find the kiddie train gone, replaced with a VR screen inside a cardboard cutout, only to be herded through the door to a crowd of exasperated parents and overly excited children.  The queues for santa photos was in three lines and atleast an hour to an hour and a half.  There was an xbox, nerf gun colouring in all while you lose your place in the herd. No sign of the toy displays the decorations were minimal and the whole experience left me greatly disappointed, so I left without spending the usual $150 on photos, toys etc I went to Big W and got my annual Santa photos of my grandkids for 30cents and I spent my $280 there.  Very disappointed Myers and so were many others"
Thanh Huyen Phan,1,Let see what Myer gave me for …,Bad,"Let see what Myer gave me for Christmas. I ordered 1 pair of Sketcher go walk 3 and some T shirts. I received a go walk 3 box with only 1 left foot go walk 3 shoe and the right foot come from a different Sketcher model.To avoid busy time in December and get an on time present for my Dad, I ordered on 24.11.17 ( I need them no later than 15.12) and here what I got this morning. So disappointed with Myer. You ruined my Xmas.I did inbox Myer on Facebook at 10.40am the same day, and it seems like noone has read it. I called customer service at 11.00 and no more stock is available for me to exchange now.  HoHoho. even I did return but I still feel so angry and disappointed with services. Ah someone inboxed me at 3.30pm and ask if he can no anything. I reply about 4pm and until now noone read that message. How can you say to client that then you never check inbox? ""Sorry"" this word doesn't enough. Free return--> not enough at all. What i want is present for my Dad. I want to post photo of shoes box and all the inbox chat to see how good their customer services is, BUT they do not let anyone post any photos on their pages even website. Oh dear, never ever come back to Myer again."
Mag8pies,1,Crap credit card,Bad,I am a full time lawyer who is taking only the maternity leave granted by my Eba. The new lender will not grant me a new card without calling my employer. This is despite me providing a pay slip of what I am earning on maternity leave and I go back next week!  Nope. Shopping at David Jones
Virginia McKinnon,1,Re application of New Myer Card,Bad,I tried to use my Myer One card in store with my new Latitude card but it was rejected.As I am a self funded retiree with no taxable income I was rejected for  the new  replacement Myer Card yet Latitude Finance gave me a visa card straight away on application.As a longstanding customer using the Myer card NEVER failing to pay a bill on time counted for nothing. Myer have cut out a big proportion of their customer base if it doesn't include retirees  as worthy cardholders. Self funded retirees  support themselves and do not rely on the aged pension.Myer were also tardy in providing information on the New Card and Latitude Finance supplied their information re a New Card first.
Lee Collie,1,Long time MYER customer,Average,"Long time MYER customer, living 3 minutes from the Southland store. Have watched MYER’s decline over the years. Experiences have gone from one extreme to the other...either several staff ‘swoop’ on me or I can’t find any staff around the register when I wish to purchase. Whilst waiting at the counter I’ve listened to loud conversations as staff (who have made eye contact) wander around talking to colleagues on mobile phones, outlining new strategies for instore stock displays etc. Often I’m told to “go over there as I’m a rep for a specific brand”. I hate being called “darl”, “darling”, “love”. Staff members have not said this with malice just an outdated attitude. Yesterday, as I was browsing, two staff members were discussing their rosters and venting about other staff members (the positive thing was they left me alone to wander). A month ago I had a bad experience with Click and Collect requiring contact with CS over a period of a fortnight. I have given them regular feedback during the many calls it took to have the refund finally deposited back on to my credit card. Won’t ever use that C and C again in the future. Happy to say I’ve always found the TS staff at Southland very helpful and patient. A few weeks ago I decided to submit the questionnaire regularly sent to me to praise the TS staff. After filling in all of the questions I proceeded to press ‘submit’. Unsuccessful! I couldn’t send it. That was the last straw."
Dongjin,1,Im a 17 year old asian kid,Bad,"Im a 17 year old asian kid. Twice i was waiting behind person being served, whenever someone came behind me they were served before me? Even heard the guy saying serve that lady first then him. Just find this very disappointing i bought more shiz then them anyways"
Foria,1,I will give Myer no star if I can!,Bad,"I made an online purchase(NEWA100AU Skin Rejuvenation & Wrinkle Reduction System) via myer.com.au on Oct 23rd, and got the delivery on 30th. However, the gel I got is expired(expiry date 12/06/17,and I have attached a photo).I went to Myer Doncaster Westfild asked for an exchange, but I was told this product is online only, and they don't have any stock. When I made the online order, the product was on sale, which I paid $229, and the price went up to $499 now, so I stated that I wanted an exchange not a return, but as they don't stock this product, they suggested me they will do a return for me, and asked me to call customer service and placed the order via phone with the sale price. So they processed return for me at store.I rang customer service after I got home as I was suggested, and was told that this product has very limited stock, and they can't order for me as it's highly unlikely the order will go through even I pay full price now, and even the order go through, there is a huge chance I will get expired stock again, as that might be why it was on sale (I don't think it's ok to sell expired stuff even it's in a cheaper price!!!).  And then I was told by customer service that I should have just accept the return or keep the product. Customer service gave me an email address to write to, but after 5 days, I still didn't receive any reply. Then I used the Myer ""email us"" web page, wrote again, submitted, and it showed a confirmation email would be sent to me shortly, after 24 hours, no confirmation no reply no nothing. 1, The product I received is almost expired for half a year, which is shcoking! How can Myer sell expired stock! Customer service suggested I should accept the return or just keep the product, but the thing is I want the product, just not an expired product! I can still see NEWA100AU Skin Rejuvenation & Wrinkle Reduction System seeling on myer.com.au (full price), but customer service just told me the stock is very limited, and might be expired as it was onsale, so does that mean Myer is still trying to sell expired product online???!!2, On the website, it doesn't say it's online only product. When I check availibility using my postcode, it shows Hurry limited stock. FREE pick up in store.  That's why I travelled all the way to the store and wanted an exchange. However I was told it's online only product when I was in store.3, I was told very different things from the store and customer service, which is very confusing. The store told me to return first and called to place order, and customer service told me can't order via their end, and asked me to write and email to complain, however I didn't get any reply from Myer. 4, It was purchased as gift for my mum, but as Myer sent me expired stock, so now I won't get her this product ontime.5, I wrote to them using their 'email us' webpage, and after I submitted, it showed I will receive a confirmation letter shortly, and well, it didn't come at all!"
Joanne Ellat,1,Went into Myer at Garden City Perth on …,Bad,"Went into Myer at Garden City Perth on Sunday the 22.10.2017. I needed to get me some lip gloss from the Chanel Section. The female sales rep there, as they do ask if there was anything she could do to help. As I was  looking at the lovely colours available, I noticed that she had not moved, and in fact I think she actually stood closer. Feeling rather uncomfortable, I repeated that it was ok as I was ""olnly looking and would seek her out once my choice was made"". Well !?!?! Low and behold, she continued to remain. I piked up "" Why are you breathing down my neck here"". She said its her job...""Do you think I'm a thief, because I can assure you that I am not as these are products that  I uses and am only looking at the different colours"" OHHH MY GOD !!! She did not move. I decided to leave and when I did, she Sarcastically said, ""Thanks for you Service"". I went straight to David Jones and bought my products."
S. Shaughnessy,1,Customer service line useless,Bad,"Customer service line useless! I wanted to order a BBQ from Myer. I have gone personally to about 3 of their shops and all told me that they were sold out and last one said all Myer locations in the Sydney region were sold out. Literally, the next day, the BBQ came online on myer.com.au FOR SALE!!! . I quickly converted all my hard earned creditcard points to buy it which I have been saving for ages just to be able to buy this BBQ. Happy me, placed the order, next day, the BBQ itself gets cancelled but all the BBQ accessories (specifically made for that model) are still delivered to me. Now I have to go out of my way to return the items and now I have loads of Myer points which I could of spent somewhere else where they are more useful to me. By speaking with their online customer service center, the girl was very rude, with no signs of empathy, and the only reply I got was' we will be happy to provide you with a refund for the items that will get delivered'....... are you for real? That is the least I would expect them to do!!!, but apparently because we agreed to their T&Cs which say they can cancel an order anytime, its alllll goood... not even an apology, sorry for the inconvenience, we messed up, here is a $5 - 10 dollar coupon to shut you up.......... nada!!"
Momo,1,The CBD Sydney Myers store has …,Bad,"The CBD Sydney Myers store has consistently poor service over the years. The Manager of the shoe department who wears glasses and a pony tail, needs to have management and Customer service skills reviewed. Time of visit is 17/10/2017 at around 6:00 PM."
Venus,1,Poor Customer Service at Bobbie Brown counter,Bad,"On 16 October 2017, I went to the Bobbie Brown counter after work and was hoping to proceed a quick purchase because I had a big day at work! The Greek looking lady with curly hair told me that I should use number 4 foundation because she's using 3.5. Well, many Greeks have thicker hair and darker skin colour than Asian she might not realise. Anyhow, she also suggested me to buy a cheaper water based foundation because the serum based would cost me $98 ... I wonder what made she think I didn't want to pay $98 🤔 Because of her poor customer service, I decided to shop at DJ. The lady at DJ turned out to be more professional and knowledgeable. She explained the differences between the 3 types of liquid foundation to me, she has also confirmed that there was no way I should use number 4! She couldn't understand why the lady from Myer would make the illogical suggestions and comments, so do I! I won't shop the Bobbie Brown at Myer Sydney City again because of the unprofessional poor customer!"
Ingrid Bartle,1,Got msn telling me I had a $50 voucher …co,Bad,Got msn telling me I had a $50 voucher I understood I could use at a Myer store. Instead a survey then choose from products that are junk as far as I am concerned. Because of the survey I will get more junk on my phone as well. Am very disappointed.  I wish you would be more honest. I liked Myers .
Clarisa Agudo,1,Myer online service is terrible,Bad,"Myer online experience has been less than favorable this year.Ordered 2 pairs of shoes on 16th Sept. Order went through. Next day received email change to order, one of the pairs of shoes were now out of stock.  When I received the second pair, shock horror, one shoe had a security tag. Obviously, no one opened the box and checked the shoes. What a disappointment, no care taken to ensure all is correct!!Ordered a pair of shoes on 22d Sept. Order again went through. Emailed next day, order cancelled as item was out of stock.Obviously, the online system is not live. Theses errors of out of stock should not occur! Very poor customer service on all fronts"
Christine,1,Myer at Knox - Reduced brand choices same strategy as Coles 😩,Bad,Myer at Knox seems to have greatly reduced stock.I was advised by a staff member that they have not reduced the stock-even though they have moved the  stock from 3 levels into just two levels.(top floor now clearance ☹️)Went looking for a frying pan. Hardly any choice in brands!I left and bought elsewhere.Not happy as previously it was always a treat to shop in Myers
Mark White,1,Went to Myer to use a gift card,Bad,"Went to Myer to use a gift card, unfortunately the card had expired. I was told by Myer staff that they could not honour the card because it had expired. The card was a birthday present, had never been used and had $100 credit. I asked to speak to a manger who informed me that if I ""actually"" wanted to purchase something, he was ""willing"" to give me a discount. I then informed him that all I wanted to do was redeem a present that was already paid for. No joy. Rang the number on the card & still no joy! Basically Myer has just stolen $100 from a member of my family. Funny enough I also had a David Jones card that had also expired, they happily  extended the card for another two years."
Simon Coultas,2,One Myer One Team,Excellent,Recently my wife and I wanted to buy a dress we had seen in the Myer catalogue. Went to the Launceston store to be told that they dont carry that designer brand. Without asking the shop assistant (Kim)then took it upon herself to check stocks and rang the Chadstone store and had a very helpful assistant (Haroula) confirm goods and size was in stock. This was done whilst I was shopping on other departments. As the store was closing I followed up with Chadstone the following day and the assistant had all my details and I made payment. Shipping was via Australia Post Express (2 - 3 days we were informed). The very next afternoon went to my post box and there was the dress as orderd carefully packed and very rapidly delivered.Full kudos to Myer for initiative and Australia Post for amazing delivery. For bricks and mortar retailing to survive this kind of above and beyond service will go a long way. One happy wife + one happy man :)
Josette Bonello,2,Not enough staff to take my money,Bad,Typical Myer. Waiting to pay but ofcourse theres no one there to take your money. This happens all the time. Fathers Day tomorrow and they have one staff member at the cash register and then she disappears and leaves a long line of customers waiting. I decided to put my purchases down ($200 worth) and buy elsewhere and that's why your sales are down !!!!! A big company like Myer yet they are too stingy to employ more staff. Well Im not shopping there any more
Timir Gyani,2,rude and doubt honesty of customers,Bad,"rude, irresponsible, doubt your honesty if you are after items under sale or discounts.very bad experience at Myer store at Werribee. I think that is the reason they do not show contact details (email or office / person for customer support details) clearly on their website."
Freya Bland,1,Absolutely pathetic,Bad,"Absolutely pathetic. I brought 3 items and paid for them and then received an email two days later notifying me that two of the items had been cancelled due to 'technical difficulties'.  For a company this, it's the worst online shopping experiences I've ever had."
Jatin Hinduja,3,Unreliable,Bad,"Unreliable, fraudulent and worse customer service over the phone.Placed an order online and next day I receive an email saying they have made changes to my order. When opened my email, guess what the whole order consisting of 22 items was cancelled.Why advertise when you don't have the product in stock? I reckon they chase for data (Credit card info) so when you place orders and pay via Credit card they capture the information to use the details in future for fraud purposes."
Sarah Webster,2,Click and collect...don't bother,Bad,"Click and collect at Myer is terrible. They allow you to order items that are not available in the store. So you have to wait from them to transfer it from another store. So far it's been 5 business days and it hasn't made it from Sydney to Canberra. I should have asked for postage much faster. Now I'm not going to have a birthday gift to give tomorrow. They need to take note from david jones and only offer what is available in store, everything else should be posted."
Jeanine,3,15th August 2017,Excellent,15th August 2017Did some research online for deep fryer. Found one online but needed to confirm extra discount via phone call. I rang nearest Myers eastdardens NSW where I spoke with a young lady called Shaima.Lovely manners along with pleasant attitude. Very helpful and accommodating to what I was requesting.Went in the next day to pick up the product and served by Sharima and a Young gentleman called Jesse. Again great manners and attitude towards me as a customer. Don't see this often enough these days.Having said that I try to treat the workers with the manners and respect that I expect from them. Rarely fails me.Thankyou guys will be back to give you my business for sure.Job well done ! Jeanine
Jane Barnard,1,Myer Chadstone,Bad,"Myer Chadstone - had ordered a click and collect - knowing I wouldn't have time to shop and that I needed it for my daughters birthday the next day. Got email to say that it was ready to collect - I raced in to click and collect - rang bell and got a women who smelt of cigarette smoke who came and took the number off me and came back with a small bag.  I asked her where the second part of the parcel was she rechecked the purchase and picked up the phone.  The purchase was a $65 face cream from Clinque which was advertised with a gift with purchase - no gift.  She got off the phone and told me that I had to go Clinque to get the gift.  So the escalators were out and I had to return to the lifts to go upstairs - taking much longer than I planned.  Get to Clinque and retell the story to one person who hands me over to another person and I have to retell her the story - she says ""let me check what you purchase to make sure you qualify"" - how rude made me feel like I had done something wrong!  She then said - lucky last and threw it in my bag - again how rude!  I just turned and walked away - she sarcastically said ""Thank You"" and that was it - I said how dare you - you have no idea what I have just had to do to get me click and collect - she spoke over me and kept saying ""manners go a long way"" so bloody rude - her name was Francis and I have never ever had to deal with anyone like that at Myer! I told her I would never buy another thing from Clinque and it was her fault she told me she didn't care and pushed her name badge in my face.  So disgusting - a customer should never be treated like that she needs to find a job where she can use all that power she so desperately craves!"
Ian,1,Sunday 6th Aug,Bad,"Sunday 6th Aug, 4:00-4:30. Level 4 Menswear.the guy at MYER polo ralph lauren was a joke.three staffs at Ralph Lauren Mens were chatting to each other.As I went went through the racks and got closer, the idiot turns to me, ask in a unfriendly tone, no smile on his face "" can I help you?"" I replied "" it's okay, I'm just ... "" and before I finishing my sentence, the MALE sales turned his back on me and made a look on his face... the girl staff is looking at him with a funny smile on her face....I lost my appetite, it's disgusting behaviour, and I left. I'm sending this to ACCC as well."
Julie,1,Worst customer service ever.,Bad,I was made to feel I was a complete inconvenience for buying goods. Worst customer service skills i have ever experienced.
carl,1,Myer have the worst customer service in …,Bad,"Myer have the worst customer service in the country, the staff are not helpful at all, click and collect online service is a complete waste of time 5 days waiting to collect my order (including the weekend) 3 business days to get an item sent from 1 store to another tomorrow will be 4 days. They enjoy taking the money."
Joan,2,I recently purchased a pair of Guess …,Bad,I recently purchased a pair of Guess shoes at a cost of $140.00 from Myer Carindale.  It is the fourth pair of this style of shoe I have purchased.  Whilst wearing the shoes at work the heel on the right shoe came loose.  Fortunately it did not give way completely or detach which may have caused me an injury such as a rolled ankle.  Last weekend I returned to Myer Carindale to exchange the shoes and was informed that the damage was caused by the way I walk and not any defect in the shoe.  I was surprised by this response given I have owned 2 pair in the past and currently have a pair sitting in my wardrobe and have not experienced this problem.  I am very disappointed with Myer's position with respect to my defective goods and wonder what benefits there are to being a member of the Myerone Loyalty Program?  I won't be purchasing shoes from Myer any time soon and recommend other consumers follow my lead.
Linda,1,Once again Myer has proved to be a time …,Bad,"Once again Myer has proved to be a time waster. Went to my local store to take advantage of the 20% off foundations to find that the Estee Lauder kiosk does not stock their more expensive foundation (at $145) so couldn,t even test a colour. Then thought I would buy it online so rushed home to do this only to ONCE AGAIN have it come up as NO STOCK. The previous week I had also tried to buy something online where I again had the response of NO STOCK on everything I tried to buy. What do they think they are doing? Is this a joke? I cant believe their doors are still open with this sort of service. Was actually told by sales assistant to drive 40mins to another store to buy my foundation by which time the 20% off would no longer have applied as finished at 3PM"
Cat Bauer,1,My mother and I visited the Clinique …,Excellent,"My mother and I visited the Clinique counter at Maroochydore Plaza yesterday and were served by Michelle. My mum has difficulty with speech and it is sometimes hard for her to ask for what she needs. Michelle was very caring and took time to make Mum feel special, doing her makeup and making sure she got what she wanted.She deserves a staff award. Thank you."
Rosemary Ayoub,1,I have been given the run around from …,Bad,"I have been given the run around from Myer for 2 weeks regarding a cosmetic consultation and special event makeup. I was promised call backs and confirmation every day for 2 entire weeks. I even popped in twice and they assured me they would be able to get a consultant to do it.2 days before the event, I was told that they couldn't accommodate me. I made a complaint to Myer customer Service and I got a one line response from their Customer Service specialist saying thanks and she would feed back my issues to the store........Meanwhile, Im left out in the cold with no make up....."
Meg Saunderson,1,Online order waste of time,Bad,"I made an online order with Myer. My order is arriving in dribs and drabs. So far I have had two parts of the order arrive. One item is incorrect - the wrong size, and the other is quite damaged. It actually looks like a used product. So when I rang customer service their solution is to take it into a store, return it and get my money back. If I wanted to go into a store, I wouldn't have ordered online! Shoddy product and incorrect order, so much for their quality control. I won't be shopping here again."
Tammy,1,The best service i have ever had....,Excellent,The best service i have ever had....i shopped in the morley store and was helped by 'GAIL' .....she was so friendly and helpful and very knowledgeable. Gail goes over and above great customer.You walk about with the exact purchase u need but very happy as she is so pleasant.
Katy Willis,1,Worst experience with online shopping …,Bad,"Worst experience with online shopping ever!!! Not only did they leave the security tags on!! Meaning I can't remove the tag so I can't wear the clothing I've purchased!! Absolutely ridiculous. But the delivery always takes longer than they state (2 weeks for delivery to Sydney at least, for a local delivery that is very slack). Their website always stuffs up too, and I've also recieved a jumper with a very noticeable tear on the side (it shouldn't be there) also I've recieved a shirt with very noticeable makeup stains on the collar. Very disappointed. For such a big company you would think they'd show a level of professionalism and provide somewhat quality service (at least match their competitors), not illustrate slack service."
Chrisitina Miros,1,An excellent online shopping experience.,Excellent,An excellent online shopping experience.
Jane Walkden,1,My son gave me  $300 gift voucher for …,Bad,"My son gave me  $300 gift voucher for Myers. I went shopping today without assistance or assistants. Where were they? Where were those people who used to come up and offer assistance etc. I told my husband (who was patiently waiting) we should just walk out with what I had purchased) and maybe something might happen.  Myers should think about getting robots behind the desk where they take your money and give you a piece of paper for all your trouble of finding the items yourself, trying them on and then deciding what you want without any help from anyone. I could be wrong but were they taken over by an American company Correct me if I am wrong?  It was not a good experience. (I stopped gong to David Jones years ago because of their superior attitude). I then went to the Country Road Store. Same experience. Two shop assistants chatting away and asked a young lady could they help her. Ignored me (I am in my 70's) but I could also have been shopping for my four teenage grandchildren (or myself). Nothing bought.  I went to Zara. The only assistants I saw there were moving clothes around on hangers and just left me to my own devices. I realised that I was in the wrong store.  I then went to Uni Qlo. What a change!  As soon as my husband and I walked in we were greeted and asked 'how we were'. I know they must have been told to do all this. But they went and got my husband a chair to sit on and all through my shopping experience I was asked if I needed any help or was I ok. Not too often to be intrusive but I was always conscious that there was help there if I needed it. I felt very comfortable shopping there and judging by all the people that were shopping there they must obviously felt the same. The staff, the prices and the goods they were selling made the whole experience worthwhile. And next time I am in Miranda shopping for clothes the first place I will hit is Uni Qlo. Maybe some of the other stores should send their spies there just to see how it is done."
Monica,1,Worst Online Shopping Experience!,Bad,"OMG! Seriously I can't believe Myer is still trading.  Their online store is horrible, there's always issues with system glitch. I don't even understand why they bother to maintain their online store, should just shut it down completely!"
Amanda,1,I purchased a lovely pair of Basque …,Poor,"I purchased a lovely pair of Basque boots in Geelong Myer I drove home to Werribee and discovered the sales assistant put 2 right size boots in the box. I was shocked because last year I purchased a pair of shoes (Mules) in Werribee Myer I got home and the sales assistant put two left shoes in the box. Its just so uncanny its like a bad shopping nightmare, I got put through to shoes then the girl from shoes left me on hold for 10 min,in fact I hung up and rang the girls in perfume and this girl Amanda helped me alot she went and got someone in shoes for me I was fuming on the phone to the manager in Geelong. She said she will post that boot to Werribee Myer and they will call me she did apologise for the staff members incompetence but the weird thing is I was never going back to Werribee Myer thats why I shopped in Geelong. Now I have to go back to Werribee and get my left boot. Should I laugh or cry? Maybe both."
Alexis Toovey,1,SERVICE ?,Bad,"My husband and I went into MYER TeaTreePlaza yesterday 17/6/17, hoping to pick up a couple of suits in the sale. What we got was nothing including service. 2 sales staff on duty the lady at the counter and the young man looking into thin air, not once were we approached. After an hour of pulling my hair out trying to work out sizing we left with no suits a headache and another bad impression of MYER their service or lack of it and their staff. This isn't the first time this has happened neither, ladies wear 2 weeks before staff all to happy to stand and chat and giggle with one another, others look away as soon as they see you. Wonder why their stores are empty? Also they look like a tip.. management time to get back on to the shop floor and crack the whip, also how about during sales take a look at departments that people need one on one service and bring on extra staff, preferably ones with personality and happy to give service. Well my money still in my pocket and now will go to another shop."
Carolyn,2,Surprisngly Wonderful Experience,Great,"On Sunday 11 June my husband and I  visited your Blacktown store, initially to browse, and perhaps purchase an item or two.  When we were looking around, your team member Peter from Electrical/Kitchenware offered us assistance.  He was very friendly and personable, and his product knowledge on a range of items was excellent.He spent a considerable amount of time with us, guiding us from one product to another; listening to our requests and needs, helping us at another area (Bedding) and going out of his way to locate a trolley as we couldn't carry everything.   Peter is a hard worker and a real asset to your company.  The only reason I cant give you 5 stars, is because I feel if you employed more people at busy times, other team members could also make the customer experience a wonderful one, as Peter did.I would give him 10 stars for his personal rating.    Please pass on our thanks to him."
Chris,1,No service in store,Bad,No service in store. Rude. Lack of staff to actually serve when you want to buy. Menswear. Ladies footwear. Younger part time staff are friendly. Older staff are rude. Myer Chermside.
Lisa Deakin,1,Shopped online,Bad,"Shopped online Spent over $200 dollars , paid an additional $16 to receive it gifted wrapped Received my items but none were gift wrapped Felt disappointed since I completed your survey for your online service and put 5 stars on it"
GSF,2,Myer online is a waste of time,Bad,"When so many businesses are jumping on to online shopping and doing well Myer seem to have forgotten the most important thing... ""The customer"". When you order from Myer online it is 50/50 if you will receive your order and their Ebay store is even worse.Myer likes to sell products that they don't have in stock.When they finally realise that they don't have any of the product (usually a week later) they either refund you without an explanation or make you wait another week to refund your money.This seems to be an ongoing problem for them going by the amount of complaints I have read.You think a company like Myer would be able to track stock levels better and would want to keep customers happy but they don't seem to care.I would only recommend shopping with Myer online if you are desperate and don't mind waiting a couple of weeks for no purchase, if not there are plenty of better sellers online."
Pratesa Joshi,1,Very dissapointed with the products …,Bad,"Very dissapointed with the products myer is selling. I already bought some clothings which had few issues.But this one ,the most embarrassing thing happened to me. I bought this coat $184 full price from myer dangerfield section but on sale and wore for special occasion. Everyone was praising for the look of it and suddenly one of my relatives at party ,point out at the whole at back, i felt so bad .i regret for buying and wearing it. Worst moment of life. I don't have trust on myer.Better go and buy out on different stores."
Rune Walsh,1,Disappointment,Bad,"I too was treated rudely by the lady name Vicky, in Chadston myer.I just purchased a $800 suit and was given a $20 voucher. We decided to use it up on the same day, we went to vue section with the intention of getting something under $20 like cup or a plate.Upon finding a cup for $15 we went to the counter and about use our gift card. This lady gave us this despising look, and whispered to her colleague ""heres another one"". Upon hearing that i just put down the cup and left. If Myer is going to do promotion like this, then train your staff to be courteous. To get this voucher you need to spend at least $100 in one transaction. If your staff is going to be rude to the people that claim thier gift cards and giving people vile looks, you might as well Not have promotions like this. And from the review from Sally he is the team leader (which i didnt know). How can a person with such poor customer service made it to that position."
Sally,1,Yes! I shop with a voucher,Bad,"Yes! I got a voucherMy family recently purchased numerous items from Myer store and due to the current promotion we received many $20 dollar vouchers (spend on Basque, Piper, Blaq and Vue). We used some of $20 gift cards on other purchases on the same day but we didn't have time so I decided to go shopping on another day. I want to treat myself with the remaining $20 vouchers, but my experience was terrible. I was shocked at how I was treated on the day I went back shopping. A lady named Vicki (team leader) working on the 17/5/17 on level one kitchen and dining wear at chadstone store served me.  I was looking at some Vue dining wear and Vicki shouted ""your're right just looking there?"" I said ""yes, thank you"" and continue with my shopping. Minuet later I heard she said to her other colleagues ""It easy to spot out which one want to use up there $20 vouchers!"". I couldn't believed this standard of service exist, especially in a big department store like, Myer.  I ignored her and continue my browsing quietly and than she looked at me with her eye browns up and said ""you want to use up your $20 dollars voucher?"".  I said ""yes"" and continue looking. When pay at the counter she said to me she notice the period of time I spend looking at the brand, Vue section with my pram and she also said to me ""you have no idea how frustrate I was with customer using this voucher the whole weekend"".  When I pay the remaining amount after I used the vouchers she also told me that there are people who spend a lot more than me.  I was being judged, bullied and treated poorly by this lady named Vicki ""team leader"", because I was shopping with a voucher!?  The vouchers earned from monies I spent at the store. I am not there bagging for free items. I am a loyal Myer customer for many years. My whole family shops there. When I say whole family I mean not just my own but also my two sisters with kids, my brothers and mum and dad. We paid thousands of dollars each years at the store. My partner, bothers, brother In Laws, regularly buy their business suit , tech goods and other items. My sisters and myself shop for the kids, for work, causal and formal wear ,toys and mum often gets her beauty products and hand bags there. My experience was terrifying shopping at Myre store I wish for a compensation for the poor customer service, an apology and hope myer review Vicki (team leader at chadstone Myer store at dining kitchen wear). With regards Sally"
Suresh Chapagain,1,Such a terrible customer service...,Bad,Such a terrible customer service being Australia's top shopping store. It doesn't take more than 2 days to deliver any product ordered online via click and collect but it took Myer already more than 7 days and when I enquired them about the product they're like 'your ordered item is out of stock you'll get your money refunded'. I tried calling the head office to issue a complaint as soon as I spoke with the manager he told me your order has already been shipped but his colleague didn't realised and told me it was out of stock through out Australia and my money's gonna get refunded. As soon as I called him he managed to make an inquiry and send me the product just because I was complaining about the service. Such a nice game played Myer WELL DONE! Never gonna shop again.
Kim Roulston,1,Myer Parramatta,Bad,"Myer Parramatta Absolutely filthy store.Staff just standing around chatting to each other. Shoe department the worst. Thick dust everywhere and shoes just scattered everywhere. Changed my mind buying a pair with them and went to Wittner instead. Clean,tidy and great service ."
Julie Andrews,1,Customer Service,Bad,"1800 811 611Was after a Blazer Austin Melton jacket XL I saw in store at Adelaide city store but they only had sizes S M L. Went to order online but showed no stock at all. I called the 1800 811 511 Customer Service Centre to find out if any stores Australia wide had one, to be told they cannot check each store stock. I then said well do I need to call every store and ask if they have stock to be told yes you do. I ended up calling the Adelaide store and spoke to Rebecca who went out of her way to help me and advise me which stores were showing stock. I called Northland Vic who I was told were showing two, has been ordered, processed and is on its way.Thank you Rebecca from Adelaide City StoreCustomer Service Centre you need a lesson on customer service and giving excellent customer experience .Thanks"
Simiao Wang,1,I will never purchase DIOR,Bad,"I always buy other skincare in Myer (city)as well. I went to myer' s DIOR counter to buy a lipstick today. its staffs really disappointed me lot by several ways. When i and my boy friend came to their counter , no one noticed us whether they were not quite busy.  Since this is my first time buy lipstick from Dior, I ask one of the staff whether he could introduce one for me.  He pass me one of them and I ask him if i could try it.  I know there is an other product line (shining one) , so i want to try an other one. He helped me but he was not  able to hide his impatience. Actually, I want to try other colors , but his attitude make me feel bad and i just grab one and left.  The other staff even worse.  I am not pretty sure if he talked to me. He said' Oh, I felt disgusting ' to his colleges loudly as he passed  me. That was too rude . For me, this experience  will bring negative impact on DIOR's brand reputation and MYER' brand image in my mind. Your service quality was disgusting."
Shiv Lahoty,1,Order delayed and then cancelled,Bad,"I place an order and waited for a week to get it processed. Finally, I called up the customer service and this is when they said its out of stock and refunded the amount. Its really annoying to see such bad service where the item is in stock when placing an order and suddenly disappears after the order is placed. I expect a compensation for the same. order number: 1014806082"
Nanette,1,terrible service and complaint resolution process,Bad,"I am posting my letter of complaint to Myer here. 4 days later I received a generic reply at 12.30 am saying that the complaint would be passed on. It is now  total of 7 weeks since I took my handbag back and I still have not heard from themHello,I started off with one complaint now I have 2!This is the firstI received a Joan Weiss handbag for Christmas. Very much needed and liked. After a few weeks the lining started to come away, this continued to worsen until it was not usable so I took it back to Myers Highpoint on 20 th March  with receipt and expected a replacement as it was faulty. The staff were pleasant and said it had to go back for repairs. I was going on holiday two weeks from then and wanted the bag so they marked it as urgent. It is now five weeks later and still no handbag.This I'm sure does not meet the legal guidelines for faulty goods. I am a senior citizen, do not have a variety of handbags to choose from, in fact I had to borrow a handbag. When you pay $150 for a handbag and it is faulty it should be repaired in a timely manner or a replacement given. Even if the bag was ready tomorrow it would not negate this complaint as these circumstances should not happen. The staff I have dealt with have been pleasant but are going by instructions. I request that this process be revised so that others don't suffer as I have.Nanette"
Loliey Lola,1,No explanation of delay.,Bad,My parents brought a phone from Myer on Tuesday 25th of April for my birthday on the Wednesday 10th of May and was told it would come in 3 to 7 days. We waited a week and it still didn't come so we called and were told that they didn't know where it was. Australia post texted and said that it will come on the 9th of may but unfortunately didn't they then said Friday the 12th of may and didn't come. I went to track it on Australia post and they changed the date again without telling me. On Saturday the 14th of may i asked for a refund but was let down and told that they couldn't give me one. I went to track it again on Sunday the 14th of may and they changed the date again without telling me. I am very outraged and would like an explanation from Myer and Australia Post as they keep saying theirs a delay and they don't tell us why. I currently don't have a phone and am in need of one. Me and my family are very upset about the shame Australia Post and Myer have caused and we will not trust them ever again. They would always get my hopes up and I am still waiting!!! I brought it from Myer Blacktown Westpoint.
Julie Avery,1,MYER Melbourne today !,Bad,"MYER Melbourne today Up escalator not working Waited 8 minutes for a lift to be available 3 ""pay here"" desks unattended on Level 3 and no sign saying closed or where else to go to pay 2 fitting rooms closed on Level 2 Really MYER do you want customers or not !!??"
Margaret,1,Thank you Cat Margaret at Robina Myer …,Excellent,"Thank you Cat Margaret at Robina Myer shoe department. From the moment I was wandering around the shoe department you came directly to me  and assisted me with excellent service.  From finding the varied shoes I wanted to try on and then recommending the correct shoes for my style I happily left with an excellent purchase.A very appreciative, Margaret"
Angela brati,1,Was at Myer Doncaster returning a suit …,Bad,Was at Myer Doncaster returning a suit for my husband. Whilst leaving the department alarm went off indicating something amiss. I returned with three young children in tow only to discover the sensor tag was not removed on the jacket. Attempted to leave and again alarms went off. Proceeded back to counter only to be told by some lady she was not from suits but another department I was told to proceed to another area. Children now getting a little difficult to manage. Manager called products checked again and continued to find alarm tag on pants had not been removed.  Finally able to leave without beeping but very frustrated with lack of service at Myer. Myer not my store!
Gabrielle,1,Visited Myer Melbourne ladies shoe dept …,Excellent,Visited Myer Melbourne ladies shoe dept  - I knew what i wanted but due to a high arch & instep it is not always simple . I was served by Antionette who most helpful & most patient. Thanks to her encouragement I left with exactly what I wanted.   Thankyou Antionette
Peggy Teng,1,Never recieve the correct item u ordered and rude staff,Bad,"I ordered three 25cm staub tomato pots online on the 2nd April  , they sent me three 19cm ones on the 10th April .  I called immediately for exchanging and returning the wrong products.  They sent me the wrong stock again on the 19th , customer service representitive told me they made a mistake on system barcode , they do apologize and offer me $20 online voucher. They advised me to call back within two days (Saturday )and they will be able to exchange for me. By the time I called back on Monday 24th , I have to make six phone calls, I have to explain my story again and again . When they asked me to hold they just hang up on me ! Unbelievable they are so rude! The last called was connected by 5:50, they told me they are don't have this 25cm ones , they only have the 19cm, their official website made a mistake. When I check online , this 25cm pot is still available, I told this to the customer service representative and he insist they can't exchange for me , and they had already issued me a $20 voucher , u should be happy and what else do u want ! I told them this is not acceptable !They guarantee will be call me back in the second day unfortunately I haven't hear any feedback from them for 10 days !"
J,1,22/4/17 Never in my life I would ever …,Bad,"22/4/17 Never in my life I would ever speak negative of the staffs at Myer Chadstone I strongly believe they are highly respected people and I have always been satisfied with your services but today is an exception. Heading to level 2 Myers Chadstone we were looking around for school shoes. So we went to the section near the children's clothes hoping to ask a staff walking by for directions. A particular staff member I would say she is quite old with neat short grey hair neck level, she wore glasses, a white blazer with black pants I would say skinny to average figured.i was sure she was a staff member because she was holding an orange key with Myers logo on it. She walks by me so I approached her politely saying excuse me. She shook her head not even any eye contact at me and walks off slowly to the other section where the kitchen appliances were and ""pretended to look busy"" touching and shifting a few things and walks back to another section. I completely understand if she was busy or she wasn't sure of providing the answers to us. She totally ignored, no eye contact just shook her head and walked away lik she owned the place , walking slowly she wasn't even in a hurry.Not even giving me a chance to finish my question. I don't care if she was the Boss of Myers, no one should ever deserve this sort of behaviour /customer service even. I am even happy to come up to Myers Chadstone to even help you identify who this lady is. Total disappointment. This was a big shocker to me . Aggravated myself and my family so much I don't understand how this lady even got hired. I know this is probably not a big deal but it really frustrated me and I hope no other customers would go through what I had today. Rudest person I have ever come across and it's a shame it's at Myer Chadstone!"
Catherine,1,Unethical refund policy,Bad,"It is unacceptable that the refund policy for purchases completed by a Coles Group gift card, would only allow for the refund to be made to a Myers Return Card. How is this considered as a refund? This is what you would call an Exchange or Credit note. Just like how any other purchase is made, the refund should be made to the original source. You are confining me to shop with only Myers when it's supposed to be a refund. This is a consumer rights breach and I will be taking this further to Fair Trading if I don't receive a satisfactional outcome within a reasonable time frame. What's worst is that you won't even allow me to submit a complaint on your site!"
Susie Haywood,1,BAD BAD management,Bad,"BAD BAD management, heavy favouritism, lack of staff. no direction ..MYER IS NOT MY STORE!"
Rahul Nagre,1,Myer: Terrible Customer Service,Bad,"Bought an item today morning as Myer committed to allow me to collect the item today itself. When i visited the Myer Melbourne Store's click and collect kiosk at 6:30 pm, the order was not ready to be collected. Did not expected such a pathetic service from Myer. When enquired to check why it is not ready, the person at the kiosk told that the processing team at the docks left for the day and ask me to check tomorrow. Its frustrating to have such responses. She gave me an option to buy the item from Myer and when the item is ready for collection, cancel the order. When i asked about cancellation today itself, she said system is not allowing the same. Myer should take necessary action on such irresponsible behaviour. This is not acceptable. If you commit something, stick to it without any ""conditions apply"" clause to make it as an excuse. Seriously disappointed."
Kate Hoskins,1,"Great service from friendly, helpful staff",Excellent,"My partner and I drove from Byron Bay to Robina to do some shopping yesterday. Although I had not intended to buy any clothes, I tried on some items and experienced wonderful service from Judy and Sandy in the Womens' Wear department. They were helpful, kind, informative and fun., working well together and individually. As a result I spent over $800 in this department. My partner also made several clothing purchases. As a gay couple we are not always treated with respect, but your staff were genuine, warm and accepting. I would highly commend Sandy and Judy as they exceeded all expectations of great service. Please pass on our thanks.I tried to submit a review yesterday but the page became lost so I'm not certain it was sent successfully. Kind regardsKate Hoskins"
jess,1,disgraceful and rude  service  of perfume sales in werribee,Bad,"If I can give zero star, I would give minus, it is down down store. I was bought perfume in myer werribe, the lid is leak and I went to exchanged  . but a woman sales refused me because the plastic of cover was gone, excuse me, as customers how we know the product has problem till we used it ? Then talked to counter manager a Chinese sales, she also didn't understand the problem just keep refused because packing was open , and suggested me give this perfume to other, it's most ridiculous counter manager I talked to low quality in training to understand customers. That young  woman sales at side yelling she sold another perfume. its disgraceful and such rude service attitude.   It is on 14 March 4pm The anther day I called customers service center, none picked up phone in five minutes.  it's so shameful how this kind of store still run on business and the service is absolutely low. and there is no after service such thing.  If I going to plaza I more like to visit other small store, instead myer it's is just a name nothing worth to any customer to have look . Low stock, out date display and low customers services on sales"
Jules P,1,Well done,Excellent,"Had my makeup done for special occasion yesterday afternoon 18/02/2017 at Benefit Cosmetics within Chadstone Myer. Gorgeous young girl did it even better than I imagined, I was worried as she was young and I wanted a look from the 1970s as the party I was attending was themed.  Just delighted above and beyond with result, the service and with the products she also suggested. Couldn't thank her enough. Well done Myer Chadstone and Benefit Cosmetics for hiring great staff. Would highly recommend."
Mark Hilton,1,Worst staff anywhere,Bad,"Had the misfortune of going into Myer Parramatta Westfields this afternoon. A friend and I were looking at a pair of men's shoes, and intending to buy. The female sales assistant saw us but continued chatting to the young man, while we waited and waited and waited. Twenty minutes later (!), an older woman came along, and the sales assistant served her. We spoke up and were treated quite rudely. Needless to say we walked out."
Andy,2,Worse customer service Dior Myers bondi junction,Bad,Don't even bother to go to myer bondi junction worse customer services in the cosmetics areas!  The staffs there are impolite and doesn't look like wanna work there at all ! my friend n I was looking at the dior cosmetics the staff put her hand on waist the whole time when we are looking at the product? Excuses me ? If you wanna have a happy shopping time please go to Sydney cbd Myers they give u better services there .
Sue Yu,1,Lay-by Administration Fees,Bad,"I went in on Sunday and put some items worth over $300 on lay-by at Myer Liverpool store. On Monday I returned to exchange one of the items with a dearer item, only to be told that, I would have to cancel the lay-by and redo it again and the administration fees would apply again. I enquired what administration fees, and the assistant pointed to an amount of $12 on my docket...$12! I suggested to her that, customers should be made aware of this fee when putting items on lay-by. She said, we usually do but, the person who served you is new and probably forgot to mention it. NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If I knew that the fee was $12 then, I certainly would not have used the service. I have previously paid lay-by fees of $2 elsewhere but, never $12. That's pure highway robbery. Shame on you Myer!"
Maureen,2,CUSTOMER SERVICE????? TRAIN 'EM UP MYER!,Bad,"No Myer in Noosa area so drove to Sunshine Plaza at Maroochydore today to spend 2 x $50 Myer gift cards I received at Christmas. Arrived in-store approx 2:30, Fri, Jan 20. Spent most of my 30 minutes mainly in ladies' wear, shoes & apparel. Either overpriced or poor quality, also too much to choose from, One staff member in shoe dept, SIX young staff members in one area of make-up - the corner right next to clothing as you approach the beauty section from back carpark door. All giggling & chatting to themselves while six customers checked out the selection nearby. I can honestly say that in 30 minutes browsing NOT ONE staff member where I wandered made eye contact with me,  greeted me, nor asked me if I needed assistance. NOT ONE! I took the escalator upstairs & wandered around, yet again, NOT ONE staff member acknowledged me. Myer need to train their staff in customer service, how to smile, greet & acknowledge their customers genuinely. If I didn't have gift vouchers I wouldn't have gone into the store because customer service (or lack of) previously, has put me off. Today at the Plaza I purchased items from Portmans, Kmart, Target & Forever New plus had morning tea, lunch & afternoon tea with husband. I was ready to shop but Myer missed out. I need to return to spend the gift vouchers, but won't be going over the $100 limit."
d peony,1,Treated like a thief by staff at Myer,Bad,"Today my 14 yrs old son and his 4 other classmates went to Melbourne Myer city but was follow by a staff member around menwear Nautica department.  They realised they are being follow openly so 2 kids went up to the myer staff and ask can they help her. She  replied is her job to follow them around but never once offer customer service about nautica products??? Since when Myer treat their customers in store like a thief right behind all the way till this poor 5 kids dcided to leave the store uncomfortably. How dare this staff member threat kids like this. I happen to give my son $300 cash for Christmas because he told me he like nautica and he wanted to choose his own clothes himself. Obviously Myer think young kids are not serious to shop or no money to buy. Well too bad,  I end up taking my son to DFO nautica outlet at a cheaper price and friendlier customer service. You can keep your products Myer. Please who ever you are, what you did to this 5 kids is offensive and not customer service. Shame on you!!!!  I am shock when my son ask me tonight , mom is it normal to be follow by Myer staff right behind when shopping?  Shocking experience for a 14yrs old kid and i decided to share his experience here."
Wendy,2,Noisy awful shopping experience,Bad,"We went to Myer, The Sydney city store this week.It was like walking into a disco, the music was so loud we could barely converse let alone think.It does not make for a happy shopping experience, we had many items on our list to purchase but because the noise was so stressful causing an instant headache we left without spending very much money.Your loss Myer, turn the sound down, not all of your customers are teenagers!!!"
Jeff Cooper,2,Utterly Disgraceful Shopping Experience,Bad,"My girlfriend and I went to Myer, Perth City on Saturday, 17th December and found a pair of shoes she liked and wished to purchase.At around 11.45am, we went to the Cashier/Service Desk in the footwear department, which was a dual terminal/service counter. One of the staff was serving a customer in front of us, so we queued behind her and there was no other customers near the counter at that time. Unfortunately for the customer in front of us, and after a very long wait, the Sales Assistant returned to advise Myer did not have her size. During this time we were quietly waiting, we approached 3 ""Sales"" Girls for assistance, who advised that they were unable to assist us, as they can only sell another brand of shoe - Nine West and went back to continuing there long, private conversation, giggling and laughing to themselves, looking across to the queues of people starting to mount up at ""our"" Sales counter no more than 4 metres away ! What an ABSOLUTE DISGRACE to experience their indifference towards us and the other customers waiting. At this time, another Sales girl appeared at the same counter we were at, but was looking on the computer screen for something, did not appear to be serving anyone at all and did not offer us any assistance to purchase the shoes we wanted.Finally, when the customer in front of us and the Sales Assistant concluded their business and both left the counter, the new Sales Assistant would not serve us and advised that we had to go stand at the back of a queue of 5 others as we were standing in the wrong spot .... AT THE FRONT OF THE SERVICE COUNTER ????I wanted to advise her what she could do with the shoes, however my girlfriend wanted to buy them and proceeded to the back of this new queue. Every other person in the queue were amazed and shocked at our treatment and even offered to wait for us to be served, however the Sales Girl would only serve who was in front of her at the time and wouldn't entertain helping us.After being stuffed around and waiting for almost 20 minutes to buy 1 pair of shoes, we left ... pleased with the shoes, but VERY DISAPPOINTED with Myer.I felt compelled to write to Myer to convey my absolute and total disgust at the disgraceful attitude of their ""Sales Staff"" who have NO IDEA as to what customer service is. The same thoughts were shared by other customers in the queue who were discussing it with me.This woeful effort by Myer sales staff only reinforces the fact why I will NEVER set foot in, nor shop at any Myer store ever again and I will be actively sharing my experience with as many current and future Myer customers as possible, to warn them of such a poor shopping experience and that they be best to shop elsewhere.Apart from being SO overpriced, it's easy to see why Myer continue to be viewed as a joke retailer by so many."
Anna-Marie Tina Vann,1,Total lack of staff.,Bad,"Due to the slashing of staff numbers on the floor, only two persons were available for customers on a Thursday night just before Christmas.  Of those two one was on a break. This took place on the top floor of Myer Garden City Booragoon.  If this is the way Myer treats its workers and ultimately its customers then I will no longer be shopping at any of your stores. Not good enough."
Evelyn Barnett,4,Myer unsubscribe me from reviews by sms,Poor,"I  made a purchase yesterday with Myer and went back today but was not satisfied. I receives an SMS today from Myer wanting my feedback. I told the truth which was a negative and received a text instantly back that Imhave bee unsubscribed from reviewing via SMS. Obviously unless I gave a positive review they did not want to know about it. I asked for an explanation of why a I have bee unsubscribed, but have heard nothing. Myer should not send an SMS if they cannot accept the truth. I would like Mye to contact me."
Sean Tinker,1,Online order scattered all over the country - want me to chase up with Aust Post,Bad,"As mentioned on one other review, online orders can be sent as individual items. Some of which have ended up in Queensland, others in the Northern suburbs of Melbourne. Another has been stuck at a Post Office ""waypoint"" for two weeks. Having sent two emails to Myer with no reply, I called last week. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and put it down to a mix up, so was understanding in dealing with them. I was assured over the phone that to leave it with them, they were going to sort it out. Over a week later, the items have still not arrived. So, I called again. I was told I need to take it up with Australia Post. No appology, no effort to correct or compensate, just ""oh well, we posted it (to the wrong address), so our concern ends there"". I'm a big online purchaser. There are plenty of great online retailers without risking it with Myer! Trusted name? Not online they aint!"
Yeojin Park,1,Myer need to improve staffs customer service skills,Bad,I am a very regular customer with Myer becuse they often have better value than other retail shops with same products and I have been always enjoying shopping with Myer at Chaddy and Glen shopping centre until I have met this rude staffs at Myer Bayside. I went into the fitting room to try some clothes and this girl followed me right behind and knock my door like crazy that i thought there was a fire or something emergency. As soon as i opened the door i realised she treated me like i was stealing. I was so upset with her attitude!!! I always trusted Myer becuase i belived the name and your customer service. I am not coming back to frankston bayside Myer ever again.
Catherine,1,Very frustrating customer service,Bad,"I have been a regular customer, tried calling the customer service yesterday and was put on hold for 13 minutes but still did not get a representative to pick my call. Shame! I tried again today and still no response. I guess i better shop at David jones then. I think current affairs and today tonight should know about this. I would never be a share holder for such a company. Don't know much about marketing but i do know  that customers are always right and they come first!!!  I recently shopped with next online, what a fantastic service. Cheers!!"
Tania Cook,11,Pretty good but the service can be lacking,Great,Mainly good service but if you hit a glitch ... good luck sorting it out.
Meg W,1,Double billed and won't respond to emails,Bad,I purchased a garment steamer from Myer.com in April 2016. I received the item as ordered but realised later my credit card had been billed twice for the one purchase. I emailed their customer service repeatedly but have only receive automated responses that they had received me email and would get back to me soon but no one has ever contacted me. Shocked that such a large and supposedly reputable store has such terrible customer service. Guess I'l have to contact the bank to dispute the transactions. Will NEVER shop with Myer again. Beware.
Yogeeta Nand,1,Poor customer service at Eastland Myer,Bad,"I shopped in the children's wear at Myer Eastland today and went to pay for the ten items of boys clothes today and waited at the service/pay counter for 20 minutes and there was no staff nor a bell to get attention from staff. I then moved to the toy section and it was the same story. I then proceeded to the electronics section and found a 50 something year old male staff member who was looking at shelves. I asked him for help and indicated to him that there was no one at the other counters to serve customers. He told me in a very firm manner that I needed to be patient and that staff were servicing other customers, he told me to join the line and wait like the other people were doing at the electronics counter.  I then found another helpful staff member and got served. I asked for a complaint form and she told me to go to level 4. I found out this middle aged male  staff members name and then proceeded to level 4. There I was met with a man who identified himself as a manager. He listened to me and told me that he would talk to the staff member in question. He didn't even ask me his name so I believe he was fobbing me off. He did not offer an apology and when I asked to make a written complaint, he told me that Myer did  not have any complaint procedure. I am a regular shopper at Myer but won't be returning again to any Myer stores."
fayley,9,Online - okay but separate delivery of EACH ITEM,Average,"I have used the Myers Online store a few times now and it has been ok.  What you need to be aware of if deciding to purchase online is that they SHIP EACH ITEM SEPARATELY.  I ordered 10 items of underwear and they each shipped separately. I had to go to the Post Office - the one down the road if Australia Post used an employee to try to deliver it, or the the big commercial centre half an hour away for when Australia Post used a contractor to try to deliver it.  TEN TRIPS. Seriously. If they could consolidate into one shipment that would be more sensible wouldn't it? The same thing happened the first time I used it. I bought many products as a wedding gift and had it delivered directly to the bride&groom.  I am told that they received it in dribs and drabs over 2 weeks.  A big gift with many many items is kind of cool to receive ... a gift containing one little spoon is kinda weird."
S.B.,1,Appalling warranty and customer service!,Bad,"I bought a pair of I bought a pair of expensive flats from Blacktown Myer. I have not worn the shoes for even 3 months before the in-soles ripped and shredded. When I went to Blacktown Myer to get an exchange of the shoes, the in-store manager said this is not the shoe's fault, rather it was general wear and tear, and sometimes shoes don't last more than 3 months. This frankly implies the shoes are poor quality, and grossly overpriced and intended to rip the customer off with false promises of quality. I would never again trust the store to fairly refund or exchange if the shoe has a manufacturing fault. It has been extremely disappointing the warranty service had been terrible, and customer was also terrible as the manager kept blaming me for having perspiring feet, which apparently caused the damage - which frankly is quite inaccurate and again implies the shoes are off poor quality. flats from Blacktown Myer.

Sharon Lee,8,VERY BAD CUSTOMERS SERVICE N STAFF RUDE ATTITUDE>,Poor,"Went there 2 get some shoes, 4 staff there but 2 was more INTERESTED in putting prices on the stocks then serving customers.When we approached staff n ask 4 our size was told there was NO OTHER SIZES except 7， ask her 2 check 2 be sure was not HAPPY n came back with same answer. Myer STAFF should get their PRIORITY RIGHT, SERVE THE CUSTOMERS OR LOOSE THEIR JOB.NO WONDER MYER PROFIT IS GOING DOWN WITH SUCH BAD STAFF ATTITUDE AS THOUGHT THEY R DOING US A FAVOUR。Myer was good b4 but now it's getting WORSE with those LAZY STAFF, maybe MYER shareholders don't REALLY CARE."
brett chloe wheeler,1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,Bad,"WOULD LIKE TO SAY WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE RECIEVED IN A LONG TIME SPEND 20 MINUTES ON PHONE THEN THEY GIVE YOU WRONG TRACKING NUMBER ,NOT GOOD,STILL  AWAITING MY PARCEL FROM MYER COULDNT SEE HOW IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG TO ARRIVE ASKED SO MANY TIMES FOR MELISA TO CALL BACK ,"
Elizabeth McElwee,1,prompt delivery,Excellent,"I ordered an Octonaut game online on Sunday night, received it today, Tuesday. Am so impressed.  If only we had Myer online in charge when we ordered bathroom fittings from Melbourne that took weeks to arrive ( we live in Tasmania) Thank you online service team ☺☺"
Pek,2,Rude and Unprofessional,Bad,"On Saturday I bought a Lavazza coffee machine from Myers Online and was charged twice for the order, debiting my account around $700. I immediately rang my bank, NAB, who confirmed the payment went through twice and informed me that the usual refund process could take some time. They advised me that if Myers could send them a fax stating that second purchase authority was sent in error they could refund the money immediately. On Monday morning, I called Myers' Online Customer Service and spoke to a rude person who kept interrupting me. She told me that proof of payment hadn't come through yet, and I would just have to wait for the money to come through and the refund to be authorised through the usual process, which could take around 5 days. I explained with proof   that the bank would rectify the mistake immediately so I left the bank details and fax number with her. The next day I received notice that my coffee machine had been dispatched so I knew the payment had gone through. I rang Myers again and spoke to a supervisor who stated she knew my payment had gone through twice but I would just have to wait for the refund through the usual process. She would not fax or ring the bank, stating she had never heard of a bank rectifying a error like this before. This error has left me in an unfortunate position, with only $40 left in my account for the rest of the week. I am disappointed by their lack of customer service, rudeness, and overall unwillingness to help in this issue. I will not be using Myers Online again and I advise others to not use them either."
Hera Williamson,2,Abominable shopping experience.,Bad,"Seriously, ordered two measly items from myer.com.au and had to wait over three weeks for it to arrive. They only shipped it a week and a half after I ordered it. I called three times and emailed them twice trying to find out what was going on and what they were doing about it and their reasoning was ""there was a higher than usual order volume"". It's worse service than I get from eBay, where items normally arrive 1-2 weeks after ordering and if I complain about the time it is taking they go to great lengths to keep me happy. Myer's staff were so lazy and disinterested, which is understandable since they don't really have any investment in keeping customers happy. I would not recommend anyone buy from Myer online since they're overpriced and incompetent. In fact I would strongly caution people against buying from there, since the only reason I bought from them at their exorbitant prices is that I expected their service to be quick and reliable.Most hopeless online site I've ever bought from in my life, by far. Thank god the items turned up intact or I probably would have lost my shit. Save yourself a world of irritation and just buy from somewhere cheaper and better."
Sam Smith,4,Expensive and rude,Poor,"I walked in there one day, the service I got was crap, the sales person looked at me looked at someone else then left, I went to Chandlers which had better customer service.    Then I wanted to look at Business clothing, took these 2 sales persons to help me, all they did was talk about their sex lives to what's happening over the weekend."
